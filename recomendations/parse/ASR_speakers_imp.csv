It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,815 a pair.The VLR is quite dense and heavy. Construction seems nice other than bulging out driver.  The cherry finish is to my liking as a woodworker:Seemingly the design has not changed in decades given the screw terminals. The VLR like other Vandersteen speakers uses first order crossover to keep it ""phase coherent.""  I got a kick out of this statement in the manual:And this:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Likewise listening tests comply with the latest research into proper evaluation of speakers calling for mono, instead of stereo listening:Reference axis was that of the tweeter.Vandersteen VLR MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our frequency response graphs:Oh boy!  What the heck is going on here?  We have rising chewed up high frequency response.  Response is much smoother down low but sensitivity drops like a rock to just 80 dB.  We have variation of 10 dB between that and the peaks in treble!  Did they ever bother to measure this speaker?  We also have large directivity error between 2 and 5 kHz.Paradoxically, off-axis response looks good:This results in predicted-in room response which again, is surprisingly better than on-axis:Slope though is almost horizontal which means the speaker will sound bright.  And with sensitivity of just 80 dB, will require tons of power.There is essentially no directivity control:So room sensitivity will be high.  Due to coaxial design, vertical directivity is similar to horizontal:Impedance dips very low at high frequencies:Distortion is OK at 86 dBSPL but not at 96:Waterfall shows resonances corresponding with those peaks in response:And here is the step response:Vandersteen VLR Listening TestsI started listening without seeing the measurements.  The first track was a duet of a male and female.  I could barely hear the male while the female came right through!  This theme continued with tracks segments with lower frequencies almost producing no volume  Yet high pitch sounds would come through, albeit, a bit much.  It is like someone constantly changing the volume control on you depending on the spectrum.  And not a little, but a lot.ConclusionsIt is clear to me that the VLR is designed based on ideology and not any objective or proper listening tests.  In both domains, performance ranges from OK to dismal and does so within the same piece of music!  The brand must have strong carrying power to get people to buy flawed speakers like this.  I rank the Vandersteen the second most broken speaker I have ever listened to or measured.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Vandersteen VLR.  Company needs to wake up and completely retool its thoughts about speaker design.  Customers deserve better.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1007.64.I tested it with the grill in place as it is screwed to the front baffle.  Still, I wish I had taken it apart before the measurements to get a better handle of driver locations and the three ports.  The grill has black foam behind it that would not let me find the drivers even with a flashlight.  Back panel is interesting in the way it has both screw terminals and SpeakOn:I tested using the screw terminals.The case is extremely solid and heavy especially for its size. You literally imagine it surviving a tank going over it!As you see below, the frequency response was very poor and rough.  I did not figure out why until I read the fine print on the spec sheet saying something to the effect of ""FIR Turning.""  At first this did not make sense as this is a passive speaker and FIR is a DSP filtering method.  It was not until I finished testing the speaker that I realized JBL provides a set of filters to be loaded into their DSP/DSP amps.  I wish they had made this clearer.  For this reason, there is no rating from me for this speaker as I didn't have a way to install said filters.I eyeballed the location of the tweeter through the grill.  And as noted, measurements are with the grill on.NOTE: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman products (and hence JBL) for custom integration business.  So while there is no benefit to us one way or the other how this review goes, feel free to read whatever bias you want into my subjective remarks.JBL AC25 Raw MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our anechoic frequency responses:That is one rough frequency response and only makes sense in the context of active correction in upstream DSP/amplification with DSP.  Here is the company spec which I assume is with DSP correction:Without filtering, the early window and PIR don't make much sense but here they are anyway:Horizontal beam width and directivity is not perfect but not bad either:Vertically however we have dual woofers which beam at certain frequencies (same as MTM problem but in reverse):The optimal listening angle will require some trial and error.  The closer you sit to the speaker, the more exaggerated the effect becomes.I was once again very surprised to see high distortion in JBL tweeters:Impedance is fairly high which should make it easier to drive with longer cable runs:Waterfall shows what I think is port resonances:The trough by the way is due to cancellation at the height I had the microphone as explained just above.And here is the step response:JBL AC25 Listening Tests and EqualizationAs I mentioned, I went into this testing without realizing the need for filters.  The result was boomy sound with strange emphasis of some frequencies in mid-range.  At first I did not want to attempt to develop a filter but took a shot at it anyway:I tuned the response quite a bit to have a built-in room target (sloping down) as otherwise it sounded too bright. The brightness may have also been due to distortion in tweeter -- I can't be sure.  But what is above, was a pretty good.  Turning the filter set off caused a dramatic loss in fidelity with the sound becoming dull, boomy and lacking resolution.  It simply dropped below what I could call ""hi fi.""  Fortunately with the filter in place and dual woofer's power handling, I could crank this up without any sudden increase in distortion or bottoming out.ConclusionsI realize this is almost half a review given the fact that I did not have access or even knowledge of the filters that go with the speaker.  Still, I hope the measurements provide a good foundation for someone to develop their own EQ without the need to use JBL DSP products.  Overall, I am impressed with power handling and solid packaging of the speaker.I can't provide a recommendation one way or the other without evaluating the AC25 with its companion filtering.  Wish the company would make this more clear in its marketing material.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was purchased and drop shipped to me.  It is new old stock as it is discontinued.  I see new ones on ebay listing for US $1,600.The 880 is the nicest finished and looking speaker from JBL that I have seen:That corner of my room is quite dark at night when I took the picture and doesn't do justice to the gorgeous dark glossy coating with subtle woodgrain.  It is a type of finish that would be at home on the dash of a Mercedes Benz or Audi.  At the same time, it is adorned with matt finish on top and elsewhere giving this a serious look, ready for insertion into a home theater setup.  At nearly 50 pounds, it is also quite heavy and stout speaker. Here are the specs:Very unusual configuration with the large ""midrange"" horn taking over at a high, 1000 Hz and going up to 8 kHz where a small horn tweeter takes up the work.  The former spec is a cause for concern for a center speaker.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I opted for a higher resolution scan than normal to the tune of 1,200 measurement points in 3-D space. Despite this, as I guessed, the sound field became quite complex due to interference between the two horns around the crossover.  Here is the error for the on-axis response relative to computed on:Given the unusual configuration, I set the reference axis to slightly above the center of the midrange horn.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.JBL Synthesis Array 880 Center Speaker MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Wow, I must say, I was not ready for such a flat and precise on-axis response.  This is as good as top notch DSP speakers yet this is a passive one!  Yes, there is an interference where the two horns fight with each other but per intro, the actual trough is narrower than it seems here.  So likely not very audible.Sensitivity is around 90 dB which is excellent and right on the money as far as company specifications.Early window reflections though show some messiness:Look at the side-wall reflections as a sign of a problem to be elucidated a bit further down in the review.Predicted in-room response is still very good given the beautiful on-axis response:Unfortunately I am about to rain on this parade by posting the horizontal beam width:Ouch.  The classic ""MTM"" configuration of dual woofers causing narrow directivity attacks us here to cause the beam width to narrow considerably.  Usually this is not a problem in ""3-way"" speakers but this is not a normal 3-way speaker in that the crossover to the ""mid-range"" is quite high. This forces the dual woofers to produce the response below 1 kHz and with the wide acoustic centers, causes narrowing of the response.  We see this just as dramatically in our color coded graph:As an aside, that is some work of art!  Should make a poster of it and hang it on a wall.    Unfortunately visual beauty doesn't equate sonic beauty here for a center speaker.Typical of MTM speakers, vertical directivity is excellent, and much better than a 2-way:Back to some good news namely the superbly low distortion that dual woofers bring:And this is an attribute we want to have in a center speaker which carries most of the work in a surround home theater environment (it carries what is on screen from dialog to effects).Back to directivity, we see the mid-range horn doing a wonderful job there:Forgot to post the near-field response of the drivers:The microphone was at an acute angle to the woofer due to its configuration which I think allowed the mixing of the other woofer and sloping down.  So hard to make sense out of that part of the graph.  We do see the couple of resonances of the woofer though.  Otherwise, absence of a port means no interior resonances which is nice.Switching to more mundane measurements, here is our impedance and phasae:Waterfall:And impulse response:Speaker Listening TestsI setup the Array 880 center as you see in the above picture and listened on-axis from about 3 meter/10 feet away.  You know how it is when you eat a perfectly seasoned meal at a great restaurant?  And how your hand never reaches for any condiments?  Such was here.  From first moment on, the tonality was perfect.  And so was the dynamics especially above bass.  I could get physical resonances in my body and my seat in guitar strings!  Not bass, but guitar strings!  I had no need to reach for EQ.  Just sat there and enjoyed track after track.There are some other considerations:1. Directivity.  The sound seemed quite focused in the center of the speaker.  The halo around it was maybe a foot or so.  No, it was not like you cupped your hand around your mouth to simulate a ""horn.""  It just was a more focused sound which I think is part of the reason it can project high amount of power in mid to upper frequencies.  To confirm that I was not imagining this, I switched to Revel C52 speaker which I own.  The C52 had at least 2 to 3X larger halo around it than the Array 880.2. Narrow horizontal directivity.  Measurements don't lie.  Mover over one seat and tonality shift was definitely there.  It hollowed out the sound but not nearly as bad as some other MTM speakers.  Still, there is no denying of this fault.  In sharp contrast, the Revel C52 almost did not care where you sat.3. No sub-bass.  The closed enclosure sacrifices deeper bass you can get from a ported speaker.  You need to have a subwoofer which thankfully exist in every home theater.Comparing the overall sound of the C52, the Array 880 blew it away in dynamics and openness of the sound.  I looked up the C52 measurements and found a trough around 1 kHz (?) which I fixed with EQ.  That made the match more even as far as tonality.  But I simply could not get the C52 to play at dynamically as the Array 880 no matter how much I cranked it up with hundreds of watts on tap.  I think so much of the energy from C52 is spread around the room as opposed to focused by the Array 880 to create this differential.Overall, the on-axis response of the Array 880 is wonderful.  Off-axis, directivity problem exists to a medium level.ConclusionsThe left and right version of Array 880 was used in Harman blind testing when I took the test there.  It was the one that sounded the best to me and almost everyone in the room.  For that reason, I was anxious to test this speaker.  On-axis response of the center version explains again why I liked it so much.  Unfortunately as a center speaker, it doesn't deliver the goods beyond on-axis.  Otherwise, it is one of the most perfect executions of a speaker in this size I have heard and measured.I can't recommend the JBL Synthesis Array 880 speaker as a center speaker unless you only care about one seat in which case, it gets one of my highest recommendations."

It was kindly purchased used by a member and sent to me for testing.  Despite the fact that it came out around 2003 (?), it is still on sale for US $2,700.The VCC-5 is by far the deepest and heaviest center speaker I have tested:It weighs nearly 70 pounds requiring help from my wife to test it.  It is hard to see from the picture but there are two woofers on each side inside some kind of enclosure and then a coaxial (?) driver in the center.  Despite being used, this is a very clean specimen. I got a kick out of the old school screw terminals in the back and a paper manual having a $5 cost written on it!   There is lengthy discussion of placement around rear projection TVs and magnetic interference.  The old terrible days of back pictures....I did not think the grill is removable so did not attempt to do so.  All testing is as you see.Here are the specs from the company.  Note the use of first order, 6 dB/octave crossover:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I opted for a higher resolution scan than normal to the tune of 1,500 measurement points in 3-D space.  Despite this, the sound field became complex 4 and 9 kHz, pushing the error up to 2%.  Elsewhere it is comfortably below 1%.Reference axis for measurements was roughly the center of the driver (I could not see it through the grill so went by dimension of it).Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Vandersteen VCC5 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:I must say, I did not expect the wavy response in bass.  I think the little ""transmission"" line they have for the dual woofers must be causing ringing.  I was disappointed to see overall levels not matching and changing in different regions.  It just isn't a pretty sight to have errors across the entire audible frequency band in one form or other.Early window response shows somewhat the same story:Putting the two together we get:Since I could not see the drivers, I only took a shot of measuring the central two-way driver in near-field:I was impressed with how nice and flat the response of that driver is in low frequencies.  Yet when combined with the woofers, it loses that.  That deep notch at 5 kHz could be an artifact of near-field measurement of the coaxial driver.In center speaker you want wide and smooth directivity.  Sadly we don't have that here:Directivity narrows as the midrange driver beams.  This goes on to 5 kHz when it suddenly widens as the tweeter takes over.  So I expect the tonality to be different for listeners outside of sweet spot in the 2 to 5 kHz.Contour plot shows the same:Note that I have switched to 3 meter distance vs the default 10 meter I have been reporting until now.  It doesn't make much difference but it is more typical of far-field listening distance in home situations.Here is our vertical where the coaxial driver shines, producing similar response to horizontal and better than many 2-way solutions:I took three snapshot of the entire 3-D directivity:Very well controlled but you clearly see the shrinking directivity in the third globe. Impedance plot shows a prominent resonance:3.7 ohm minimum impedance is very low but fortunately the company tells you it could drop to ""4 ohm.""A benefit of low order crossover filters is supposed to be better ""timing"" response.  So for those of you who cheer such measurements, here is the impulse response at 1/3 meter:I could not draw a lot of conclusions from distortion measurements other than not liking the mid-frequency rise at higher SPLs:And too high in bass relative to output we are getting:Vandersteen VCC5 Listening TestsListening to the VCC-5 was not that great.  I didn't like any of the tracks I was playing.  Both the lows and highs were unpleasant.  I brought out the EQ tool but it was very challenging to hand create parametric filters to correct the shelving errors in its frequency response.  Still, I put together a set and listened to it.  I thought it made some difference but was not positive about the benefit.  So I performed a few blind tests of the EQ vs not.  At the end, it was not conclusive.  Sometimes I liked my EQ better, sometimes the default.  In other case, I was not enjoying the sound.I realized I had spent some time outside so my ears were plugged again.  To see the impact that, I moved the speaker wire to my Revel Salon 2 and I could believe the transformation.  Wow, every one of my reference tracks were once again beautiful, with great tonality and of course plenty more bass.  Thinking is is unfair, I swapped out the Salon 2 for Revel M16.  I lost two thirds of that joy but still, the overall tonality and clarity was so much better than Vandersteen.  I switched back to my salon 2 and enjoyed my music for the next hour.  I did test for directivity.  You do lose some brilliance in music as you move over one seat but it is not dramatic at that distance.  Closer to the speaker it was however.The VCC-5 can play loud but it doesn't have much deep bass.  You must have a sub as otherwise it won't be satisfying at all.ConclusionsI watched a streaming video of company founder, Richard Vandersteen on a speaker panel at one of the other shows a while back.  Towards the end, the moderator asked each panelist to comment on advancements in speaker design.  Kevin Voecks from Revel answered first by saying there was huge advancement in distortion measurements with Klippel system.  Mic moved to Richard who said: ""nothing!""  That old rules hold and there is nothing new.  Well, given the performance of VCC-5, I say he is firmly mistaken.  This speaker could certainly benefit from proper measurement and optimization of crossover to say the least.In fairness, the build quality and power handling is excellent here -- things you get robbed on with modern budget speakers optimized for cost.  The finish is furniture grade (although old-school) and you get the feeling you are paying for something substantial. I can't recommend the Vandersteen VCC-5.Edit: I added a poll.  Please vote what you think of its performance based on this test.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 2.7 Hz. Over 600 measurement points were used to assure high precision in higher frequencies. I am also using averaging to lower noise in bass frequencies.  Accuracy of the measurements are better than 1% during most of the frequency range but drop to about 2% in 5 to 10 kHz range.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: I am not happy about the performance around crossover frequencies as levels don't seem to be matched, especially around the mid to tweeter.  We see distortion characteristics matching this as well:Coaxial drivers are good in the way to provide similar vertical and horizontal response.  This can be a good thing or bad.  The latter materializes here to some extent in that what you get on-axis, you also get off-axis resulting in predicted in room response to also be choppy:Most preferred response here is higher frequencies dropping off gradually as otherwise the speaker sounds bright.  Here, the drop is quite slight so you likely will hear a brighter than preferred response.  Fortunately this aspect can easily be fixed with ""target curve"" of an automatic or manual EQ system.For center speakers as I noted earlier, we want unified response on and off-axis and we have that here:Impedance for a change is above 4 ohm for a compact speaker:Pretty Speaker GraphsConclusionsI am not setup to test center speakers so no subjective opinion there.  Objectively, response is less smooth than I like to see.  Granted, maybe this is the best you can do in a $400 center speaker.  Judging by what I see on objective measurements, I can't get excited about the Pioneer SP-EC73 so can't recommend it.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Had one of the highest shipping bills (for UPS alone) of $150 last week.

The grill was not used although it is a very transparent one so it should not impact the sound much. Measurement room was at 10 degrees C which may lower bass output a bit. Accuracy is better than 1% for most of the audio spectrum degrading to 2% above 4 kHz.Revel Concerta2 C25 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:I was very impressed with the frequency response of the C25.  Other than a gentle rise in mid region, it is almost flat on axis with excellent directivity.  Many Revel speakers have low sensitivity but not the C25.  It is better than 90 dB!  Lack of port means the classic drop off in bass response which starts at 200 Hz.You can see the nice early window directivity when we look at the most important reflections in a room:Putting both graphs together we get our in-room predicted in-room frequency response which predictably is excellent:Story is not perfect though.  We know this type of 2-way design causes cancellation and narrowing of the response in the woofer region and that is what C25 does:You need to sit quite far from the speaker to have decent coverage for seating.  I will report on this in my listening section.Quite the opposite is the case in vertical dimension providing near perfection:Another impressive area of performance is incredibly low distortion especially given the small drivers here:Narrow spikes in these graphs indicate resonances by the way which we can confirm in the impedance and phase graph:And also visible in CSD/waterfall display:Finally, for those looking for more timing measurements, impulse and step responses:Revel C25 Listening Tests and EqualizationThe first impression was delightful mid and high frequencies but lack of bass.  First correction I applied was for the slight rise in on-axis response between 1 and 2 kHz:That still did not create an enjoyable experience.  Problem was that there was enough bass there to think that there was not enough of it!  In other words, if the speaker didn't play any bass you could just dismiss that aspect.  Here, the bass response is quite anemic, constantly reminding you that there is not enough of it.  Given the exceptionally low distortion I took a shot at boosting the upper bass frequencies with Band 1 filter and I was shocked what a great improvement it provided.  Speaker tonality became much warmer and now there was good bit of tactile bass with no audible sign of distortion!I tested for horizontal coverage and answer there is not good.  I could only move half a seat before tonality changed.  So if you are going to cover even a medium seating area, the response would not be optimal.I then turn the speaker 90 degrees.  The sides are flat and wide so speaker was quite stable this way.  What I heard was mesmerizingly good!  Spatial projection (halo around the speaker) enlarged and I was listening to truly high fidelity sounding speaker.  ConclusionsThis little speaker (less than 24 inches wide), is superbly designed in many areas but can't escape the physics of dual woofers causing narrowing of the response in horizontal axis.  As such, it is not a great choice for a center speaker if you want coverage for more than one seat.  Use it for one seat and/or rotate it vertically and you have a compact yet fantastic speaker with just two EQ filters.  I am still smiling about how good the sound was in this usage.  Part of the credit goes to dual woofers providing exceedingly low distortion, enabling you to play quite loud with no sign of strain or distortion.Without EQ and for center usage, I can't recommend the Revel C25.  With EQ and narrow seating are horizontally or vertically otherwise, it is a superb sounding speaker despite its tiny size and gets my limited recommendation that way.P.S.  One note on the price.  From what I have seen in the last couple of years, Revel dealers significantly discount speakers so don't go by the list price I showed in the first part of the review.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $450.As is indicated, this is a very shallow speaker:Configuration is mid-woofer, tweeter, mid-woofer.  There are no ports:Back panel has a soft-feel (""rubberized"") paint.  Hopefully it won't get sticky over time.  The kick stand is loose which doesn't give me confidence that it won't fall over although it did not during all of my testing.Binding posts are screwed in terminals and worked surprisingly well.Note that the same Speaker is sold as T301 with vertical configuration and mounting hardware.  Owner kindly sent that to me as well but given the results below, I don't think we need to measure it.A compact speaker like this is a dream as far as usability below a TV on the wall which is the type of imagery company uses to promote it.  My measurements and listening tests did NOT follow that as I tested it like any stand alone speaker.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was the center of the tweeter (aligned by eye through the grill). It is getting colder with the measurement room temp at 16 degrees C. Accuracy is better than 1% for most of the range but drops to 2% for part of the spectrum.  Grill was left on (not sure if it is removable anyway).KEF T301C MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:This is a disappointing response.  Yes, without a port and in such a compact enclosure, bass response is sacrificed but what is up with that highly elevated treble response?  And much messiness between 900 Hz and 1.5 kHz?Early window reflections (which do NOT apply fully if you mount it on the wall), doesn't look pretty either:Predicted in-room response therefore is not what we are looking for:Near-field response is not very diganostic:I am measuring one woofer where in reality both are firing and creating interference pattern between them.I expect the beam width to narrow due to ""MTM"" configuration and it does, but not nearly as much as we have seen in other speakers:At first I could not figure out why it is asymmetrical but as I was writing this review, I realized one side has that KEF label so one side will have different response than the other.  It also looks like I was off a bit in my centering (hard to see through the grill).  Regardless, directivity is quite uneven as we would expect from the design:And predictably, works better vertically:There is beaming (narrowing) above 3 to 4 kHz however.Zooming in the problematic 933 Hz resonance we get this very complex sound field:I have the video at 45 degrees so that you can see its complexity.  There are a lot of components contributing to make it look this odd.I was impressed with the low distortion of the tweeter:Impedance dips to the usual 4 ohm region:For fans of timing graphs, here are the CSD and impulse responses:KEF T301C Listening Tests and EqualizationLet's get the obvious out of the way: this thing is bright sounding, super bright sounding!  Yes, it portrays that impression of ""very detailed and high resolution"" but come on, this is just too much.  The effect is exaggerated here due to lack of bass.  So even after I EQed it, it still sounded bright:That resonance around 1 kHz also contributed to the feeling of brightness so pulling it down helped.  I tried to boost the bass response but it just got tubbier sounding.  It did not however, fall apart.There were moments of excellence in high frequency notes.  Whether it is helped with frequency response boost there, I am not sure but there was this clarity and niceness that I picked up time and time again.I checked for listening angle and was surprised that at my listening distance (about 10 feet), it was not an issue moving over one seat.  I got close to the speaker and there, it is a problem as you literally hear the speaker center shift from tweeter to the woofer you are closes to. This goes away as you move past 1 meter/3 feet or so.  If you are mounting the speaker on the wall next to the speaker and it encourages people to walk up to it, this may be an issue for you.Wondering about resonances I saw in measurements, I touched the speaker cabinet as it was playing.  This thing resonates with *every* note in music!  On normal speakers it is the strong bass notes that cause resonances you can easily feel.  Here, the cabinet was continuously vibrating no matter how the music changed.  Form factor here is really getting in the way of good performance.Conclusions When you have a speaker from KEF, yet it is chasing the same marketing message as the rest of the crowd, you want to think that they have somehow bent the laws of physics to do better.  While that may be true to a small degree, the T301C (and T301 sister) are just not what I consider hi-fi.  It is way too bright.  It lacks bass and good luck trying to integrate a sub into it (and two others for left and right in different locations).  And has tons of resonances.  Is it better than the sound coming out of a speaker by itself?  Sure.  but don't put much hope that you can be producing serious fidelity out of this speaker.  It just can't do it.I can't recommend the KEF T301c or T301 for that matter.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It costs US $1,495 according to its owner ($350 tweeter upgrade fee).  The Horizon is a heavy beast and seems well finished:It is too heavy for my photo booth so you see it where I put to listen to it.  The fabric under it is made out of special material that helps push the electrical energy that would normally be wasted in speaker/crossover wires back into the speaker.  I plan to market it as an effective tweak but we digress.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was enough to compute the sound field of the speaker within 1%error.Temperature was 77 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Not too bad!  There is a cancellation around 500 Hz and a couple of resonant peaks (where all the curves tilt up together).Due to inclusion of mid-range, directivity is good which we like to see in a center speaker that has to cover wide listening area in a home theater situation.Early window graph averages to a good curve but individual reflections do vary a lot:What this says to me is that the acoustic properties of your room will impact this curve as it modifies reflections differently than our simulated room below.Putting the two together we get our predicted in-room response:The variations we saw in on-axis response mellow out a bit which is good.Directivity ResponseLooking at how sound radiates in different planes, we get this in what we call ""beam width:""For a center speaker, we want wide beam width as this allows the side reflections to hit the walls and expand the perception of the speaker to be closer to the width of the display.  Having 70 degrees here with reasonable flatness helps.  Most smaller speakers are around 50 degrees for example.I have worked on making the 3-D version of the above be easier to interpret.  Let me know what you think:An idea response would be a shaft of red color and the smoothly falling into blue.  We have a lot of choppiness here but we need to examine more speakers using these settings to get better calibrated.Here is our vertical response:We see that I put the microphone at the center of the tweeter (all the way to the right).  I can't figure out why the acoustic center of the mid-range is above that as I have indicated.  Anyone has an explanation?Anyway, vertical directivity gets very narrow around 4 kHz so best to have your ear at the RAAL tweeter center.Here is our CSD/waterfall:Speaker Distortion MeasurementsThis speaker is too wide for my current deep dive distortion measurements (I am working on fixing that) so we are just going to run with standard response we get out of Klippel system:We have a problem around 1 kHz and to some extent, around 3 to 3.5 kHz.   We can see the same in absolute levels:Notice that distortion is actually higher than the fundamental tone below 35 Hz.  This often happens and it says that what you get will not resembled the original tone.  So some filtering of that may be advised.Impedance and Phase MeasurementsThis is a low impedance speaker so best to get a capable amplifier to drive it:There are also some ""kinks"" indicating resonances.  I see one around 380 Hz for example.Speaker Listening TestsI placed the speaker in my usual spot as you see in the review photo.  But due to large width of this speaker, I had to move the stand a bit.First impression was that ""this speaker is alright.""  Bass was standing out a bit but no way of telling if that was too much or hitting some room mode.  Or else, what it should have been producing.I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with it other than my excitement level was not at max.  Yes, that is a technical term.  It is covered under US ISO standard, 23476-A (annex E).So I went and looked up the measurements which I had created a couple of days before and forgotten by now and corrected a couple of minor things:As usual, ignore the filter at 102 Hz as that deals with a room mode in my listening space that exist with all speakers.  The rest are self-explanatory and are based on predicted in-room response.  They are ""eyeballed"" so more precise computation may be better.The sum total of the speaker corrections improved detailed, gave it a bit more airiness and reduced distortion/accentuation of highs.  Not a whole lot bot some amount.Once there, the Horizon Center was very nice sounding and was capable of playing very loud.On my deep, deep bass track it would bottom out but do better than that typical bookshelf speaker. ConclusionsObjectively and subjectively the Ascend Acoustics Center speaker rated well.  It is not perfect but gets close enough at the asking price to be fine.I give it a like but for some reason is not something I would buy.

It is on kind loan from a member.  The CMT-340 SE costs US $298 from the company plus $30 in shipping.  It looks to be a design that was released 10 to 15 years ago but of course, speakers don't age like electronics.The speaker is too big to put in my photo booth so here is a picture of it from the company:This is the classic ""MTM"" configuration which stands for Mid-woofer, Tweeter, Mid-woofer.  These quickly became popular with the advent of home theater and the need for a not so tall speaker to put under or over the TV or projection screen.  The second mid-woofer was added versus a 2-way design to get increased power capability as the speaker has to keep up with the Left and Right units.  MTM configuration works fine as a vertical speaker but when placed on the side this way, creates off-axis radiation which has a cancellations varying distance between the drivers and listeners.  We will see this in measurements.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections. It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room. All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed.Around 1000 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field in all but the 8 to 10  kHz where the error is about 2% due to complexity of the soundfield (see the eye candy section).  Final database of measurements and data is 1.4 Gigabytes in size.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Research says that on-axis, i.e. the sound that comes to you if you point the speaker directly at you (as would be the case in center speakers) should be as flat as possible. I have shown this in red arrow.  We don't see that here with a dip in upper bass, followed by a peak around 1 kHz, then a dip and so on.  Company talks about having compensated by the usually poor horizontal dispersion of MTM.  I am wondering if the peak around 1 kHz is their attempt at such a fix.We see our MTM problem clearly in Directivity Index:Focusing on the blue dashed line, research says that should be smooth, i.e. no variations up and down.  It can have some title though as I have indicated with my red arrow.  We see a large deviation around 3 to 4 kHz.  That says that the off-axis response varies a lot from on-axis.  So the sound that bounces around the room versus the one coming at you directly have different tonality.  Our poor brain then has to figure out what the sum of that mess is and likely thinks the sound is colored, with a suck out in that region.  In a center channel speaker, you don't to see such a dip as that is the upper range for vocals.This also means the speaker will have room dependence as what reflects from the environment changes it sound.  Equalization cannot in theory fix any of this because it is before the speaker and whatever it does, changes both on-axis and off-axis at once so the difference between them remains (bad).  Controlled listening tests though have shown that some improvement can be made by boosting that area.  So you can try but best to listen before and after to make sure it did make things better.We can put the whole recipe together and guestimate what sound you may get in your room:Ideal response again looks more or less like the arrow I have drawn.  More bass than treble but otherwise smooth graph.  We have the overall tilt so this speaker should not sound too bright but we don't want the  variations we see.  We also have a dip in bass frequencies which may take away ""warmth"" from the speaker.  There, I used that subjectivist word!  We are done.  The rest is for speaker nerds.Basic Speaker MeasurementsImpedance graph shows that this speaker is harder to drive than the company implies:There are also some ""kinks"" int he graphs that indicates presence of resonances but they are also visible in the spinorama measurements already sown.I am trying to standardize the distortion measurements as the software always autoscales this graph:I picked 5% as the upper limit.  If I set that too low it will clip distortion peaks in other speakers.  Let me know if you want something else and why.And here is our waterfall which as noted is not anechoic measurements like spinorama is.  As such, I have gated the response in time, reducing or ruining low frequency resolution.Advanced Speaker MeasurementsNotice the narrow angle after which, response falls apart horizontally:Eye Candy MeasurementsI was surprised that the measurement system had a hard time in the region of 8 kHz, sampling the soundfield despite 1000 point measurement system.  So i zoomed there and found this:Frequencies below and after show simple sound fields as we would expect.  At 8 kHz though, we have countless sound sources.  I suspect both woofers are still playing and we have diffraction from all corners of the speaker combining.ConclusionsI don't expect many of you to have interest in this speaker but reviewing it is good because it shows all the classic issues with MTM speakers.  There are ways to optimize them better than we see here but ultimately the (near) best solution is to add a mid-range to it.  See my measurements of the Revel C52 with that addition: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...el-c52-speaker-review-and-measurements.10934/People normally think only the dialog comes out of the center speaker in movies but that is not so.  The center channel carries vast majority of burden including sound effects as it represents the center of the image on screen where the action is.  So whatever you do, don't skimp on center speaker.  Get the best one you can.  In the case of MTM, see if you can place them vertically.  That is what I did with my first dedicated theater.So overall, despite the reasonable price, I would not recommend this center speaker.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Don't make me tell you another bad joke to get you to donate money.

Beam width narrows significantly causing issues for a center speaker in home theater which needs to cover a wide seating area.  Response is not bad if you use this vertically.

Opposite of many speaker, off-axis is better, approaching ideal:Combining the two shows a predicted in-room frequency response that is excellent:So don't go building a dead theater.  You want these reflections to even out the overall response.Drive responses in near-field measurement shows very good response:Absence of a port means we don't have its resonances to deal with.  That does translate into the typical bass response for a sealed box that sloops gently up.  So sub-bass response will be there but at much lower level.Impedance graph shows pretty low dip to 3.4 ohm and near it, there is phase shift as well so you best have a powerful amplifier to drive the C208:Beamwidth is wide (which is what we want in a center speaker) but we see the same strangeness around 700 and 1.1 kHz:As shipped, speaker wants to tilt up which is a good thing if you have it set low (i.e. below screen):I was most impressed with the low distortion at 86 dB SPL and to some extent, at 96:Revel C208 Speaker Listening TestsI used my normal speaker stand which is too high for a center speaker below a projection screen.  So I stuffed some rags in the back to make the speaker more horizontal.  Once there, the sound was delightful.  It was clean, clean, clean!  Overall balance was excellent without anything standing out.  So much so that I did not bother to apply any EQ.  I just listened and listened.I tested for dynamic ability by cranking up my 1000 watt amplifier to as high as I could dare and there was no sign of stress, distortion, bottoming out, etc.  As my old saying goes, ""I got scared before the speaker did!""  Those dual woofers bring a lot of power handling.There was this super nice diffused halo around this speaker.  Anyone who thinks there is no imaging in ""mono"" needs to listen to a speaker like this.  I sat there enjoying track after track even though I was playing just one speaker.  This is what a great speaker with wide directivity delivers.The only negative I found was the lack of deep bass.  It is there, especially if you turn up the volume but it is not satisfying.  You need a subwoofer which you would naturally have in a home theater.  Note however that I had the speaker out good 5 feet from back and side wall.  Closer to boundary placement may bring more bass.ConclusionsA horizontal center speaker built to deliver high SPLs is challenging to build.  Objectivity there is a miss in on-axis response but off-axis response fills that in resulting in excellent subjective and objective performance.  Speaker is NOT however full range and needs a sub for full range performance.As a center speaker where a sub is expected to be there, I am happy to give a strong recommendation to Revel C208.  As a stand-alone speaker, it would rank one step lower as simply ""recommended.""------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

We also have some increase in high frequencies combining to present somewhat of a ""showroom sound"" for a small speaker.Near-field measurements show some pronounced resonances:The ports by the way are at each end of the speaker.Now we get to the disappointing part: horizontal directivity and beam width:A center speaker needs to cover wide audience range and this is the opposite.  The driver array has destructive cancellation that causes it to highly ""beam"" (narrow) in response from 300 Hz up to near 3 kHz.  A lot of the vocal range falls in this area so voices are definitely going to be impacted.While we don't need good vertical directivity, we have it here:One nice thing I have found with multiple drivers is that they handle power very well.  Even though these drivers are small they still do an excellent job here:Impedance is typical of speakers these days, dropping down to 4 ohms:For fans of timing analysis, here are the waterfall and impulse responses:JBL 135C Listening Tests and EqualizationI always listen on-axis to speakers which helped the 135C hide its horizontal directivity.  Here, I found the sound as predicted, tubby depending on the track and a bit bright.  Moving just half a seat horizontally, killed the clarity and openness of vocals.  Figuring some don't need multi-seat coverage, I attempted to fix the high level flaws using equalization:I put in the filter at 200 Hz to get rid of overboosted response there.  That got rid of the tubbiness but then highlighted the highs even more.  So I dialed in the shelving filter on the right and got that fixed.  Problem was, I now lost most of the bass response.  I dialed in a quick and dirty low shelf and was surprised how well that worked.  I had warmth and good bass now with no noticeable rise in distortion!  Once there, as long as you sat on-axis, the sound was quite enjoyable with good ability to play loud.ConclusionsJBL nails the price and looks of this speaker together with svelte form factor.  Alas, it attempts to fight physics and loses on horizontal directivity.  No doubt marketing and cost dictated this configuration as their competitors are guilty of the same.  Fortunately it responded well to manual equalization (automatic may not work well).  So if you want to listen alone, you should be fine.  Note that you can't use it vertically due to the ports at each end unless you hang it on the wall. I can't recommend the JBL 135C as a center speaker. ----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member.  The RC263 costs US $268 on Amazon including Prime shipping.The RC263 is too large for my photo booth so you have to settle for where I test speakers for listening:As you see the RC263 is a 3-way which is a recommended configuration for horizontal center speakers (two-way ""MTM"" designs tend to have poor horizontal direcitivty).  Inclusion of two mid-woofers should help with power handling which is critical for center speakers as in movies most of the energy is directed at it (due to anchoring the screen).  We will see this in measurements to follow.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are referenced to the tweeter axis with frequency resolution of 2.7 Hz.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We want our ""on-axis"" to be flat as to not impart constant coloration on everything we play and this budget speaker manages to do that fairly well.Sensitivity is a couple dB above average for bookshelf type speakers which is good.Estimated frequency response (taking into account important reflections in a room) is very good as well:This due to early reflections working together to produce a smoother response than one would typically expect:Here is the horizonta ""directivity"" which shows how the power of different frequencies drops off as you move away from the direct axis of the tweeter (left and right):This is very good and broad which is what we like to see in a center speaker allowing for wide seating area and good side reflections.Vertically it is a bit chewed up and narrow in mid-frequencies:The cabinet on RC263 has dual angles so suggest using the back side which points the drivers up if the stand is too low (e.g. under a projection screen).Distortion is rather high in the area of midrange and tweeter (infinity does not provide any crossover information):The increase distortion frequencies is rather broad which makes it easier to hit so likely is a much bigger problem than a spike here and there.  I am tentatively setting a 0.5% as maximum acceptable for broad distortions and RC263 violates that fair bit, peaking to 1.5%.Impedance in bass domain where most energy is dips to 4 ohm:Finally the CSD/waterfall:Speaker Listening TestsFirst impressions were rather positive but after a bit, lack of bass performance made the overall experience rather bright.  Dialing in a few dBs of bass boost cured that.  To my surprise, this did NOT result in the drivers bottoming out showing the excellent power handling of the RC263.It is said that the Infinity is the ""baby Revel.""  To see if that is true, I put my Revel C52 speaker which costs US $2,000 in the same spot.  Performance improvement was quite substantial.  Bass had much more energy, able to energize my seat.  But importantly, there was a ton of detail and ambiance which was lost with the Infinity RC263.  I had my son with me for a second opinion and that was his impression as well without being prompted.  Now, some of this may be sighted bias, and differences in frequency response or distortion.  I don't have an analysis of that for you.  But I can share that my reference tracks sounded much nicer with the Revel C52. ConclusionsThe Infinity RC263 has excellent objective measurements for a budget center speaker.  They have tried hard to hit key aspects of good sound in a horizontal center speaker within a very tough budget.  So unless you can afford to spend a ton more, the RC263 makes for a very good center speaker in a home theater, augmented by a subwoofer.As such, I am going to put the Infinity RC263 on my budget speaker recommendation together with its companion, R162 left, right and surround speakers.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Went out yesterday with the Pink Panthers wearing their pink masks and everyone was starring at them!

599,e218b590-3a7b-4666-9814-bd5c48efefb6,Center Speaker,Arendal,1961,86.0,3.5,Yes,3/22/23,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/arendal-1961-center-monitor-speaker-review.43190/,4.0,"This is a review, listening tests, EQ and measurements of the Arendal 1961 Center or Left & Right speaker.  It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs US $599 each or $1,099 a pair.This is a surprisingly compact speaker but is built like a tank.  The enclosure feels like cast metal, ala Genelec.  It has textured matt finish and feels like you can drive over it and it would not care.  The drivers as you see, have no visible fasteners and have very tight finish and tolerances.  The look of quality extends to the back:Numerous mounting points are provided.  The metal speaker binding is made out of metal and looks so good you may be tempted to have the back side toward you while you listen!  This is an ""MTM"" configuration (mid-woofer, tweeter, mid-woofer) which classically makes for a speaker with narrow mid-range/treble response.  We will see if Arendal has managed to mitigate this or not.As noted, you can use the speaker in horizontal configuration (as tested) or vertical.  There are no ports as is typical in center speakers.Reference axis was the tweeter center which is inside a deep waveguide.Arendal 1961 Speaker MeasurementsI usually start the review with frequency response measurements.  But I think it is best to look at the impedance graph first:Notice how the impedance shoots way up as we get close to DC (0 Hz).  This indicates capacitive coupling, or said another way, a high-pass filter.  We have seen this as a mitigation against overdriving in some in-wall speakers but not in a normal in-room one.  Likely it plays the same role here given the small sealed enclosure.Now on to our anechoic measurements created using Klippel Near-field Scanner:That is a very smooth response, sans slight elevation above 2 kHz and a couple of peaks.  We can see the classic high-pass response in bass but also another one above 10 kHz.  There seems to be a small signature of resonance around 15 kHz so maybe that was the reason for that roll off.Near-field driver measurements immediately tell us why we have a couple of minor humps in our response:The tweeter is resonating there.  On the positive front, the crossover is stomping on the woofer resonances out of band which is good.Edit: forgot to include the Early Reflections and PIR:The high pass filter helps to keep distortion way down for this size speaker when it comes to low frequencies:That kind of performance (on the left) is just not seen in such a small speaker.  Here is the relative response:A key concern as I mentioned with MTM design is narrow directivity.  Let's see that:Yes we have the beaming but with bringing down the crossover frequency, the effect is partially mitigated allowing nearly double the width that we typically see in small MTMs.You should have much wider sweet spot then than you would expect.Vertically we see much better response of course:To the extent you deploy the 1961 vertically, above responses become your ""horizontal"" response.CSD/Waterfall graph shows only minor resonances:Finally, here is the step response for fans of that:Arendal 1961 Speaker Listening Tests and EQI started my listening in horizontal configuration.  I was dreading to hear lack of bass but that was not at all the case.  There was plenty of bass with typical tracks.  Alas, the highs had a bit of ""showroom sound"" with extra brightness.  So I dialed in a couple of filters for the resonance points:Note that while I started by looking at the measurements, I fine tuned them by ear.  I say they may require a bit more work but it got me in the ballpark.  Once there, the ability of this speaker play loud and clean surprised the heck out of me. No matter how much I cranked it up, it played clean and very nice!  I think the key here was it not doing what it can't do.  To wit, I threw my killer sub-bass track at it and instead of getting highly distorted as just about every bookshelf speaker does, it simply played those notes faintly.  The spray of distortions in bass into upper range is a problem when this is not the case.I checked for listening width and it was very good across my entire loveseat.  At very close distance, you could detect a tonality change but that was mostly with highs getting narrower and not at all what you usually get from MTMs (where the middle falls out of the picture).  It is not as perfect as a non-MTM solution but what is there is very good.I then rotated the speaker vertically.  This comparison was difficult because the tweeter now went above my ears a bit.  I thought the overall fidelity improved a bit with upper midrange and lower treble improving slight but this could be a faulty observation.  The sweet spot did enlarge with no tonality shift at all across across my loveseat.ConclusionsArendal was given a challenge: create a high performance MTM center speaker.  While people are quick to completely write-off this configuration for center home theater speakers, there are mitigation techniques.  The main one is lowering the crossover point enough so that the dual woofer don't get a chance to beam and stay there.  We then get the benefit of dual woofers playing what would be a mid-range in a 3-way speaker (so higher SPL with lower distortion).  Mind you, a 3-way speaker can do better but will cost more and take up more space.The high-pass filter is clever in that it leaves much of the bass response there but takes out what would be pure distortion a small speaker.  With this in place, the 1961 is able to produce incredibly high SPLs despite its super compact size -- exactly what you need in home theater applications.The combination of high pass filter and slight resonances in high frequencies means the sound signature out of the box is rather bright, or put inversely, seems to lack bass to compliment it.  With a sub added, this may go away.  Alternatively, you can fix it with EQ as I did.$599 is a fair bit of money for a compact center speaker but for it, you get a beautifully built speaker making you feel like you have gotten your money's worth.I am happy to add the Arendal 1961 Center/Monitor speaker to my recommended list.  It is the most perfect MTM speaker I have tested and oozes good engineering and quality execution.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased used by a member and sent in for testing.  It is discontinued (released in 2008):As you see, the C10 is quite small.  It is a 2.5-way design with four mid-woofers, tweeter in the center and dual ports one at each end. I could not easily take the grill off so I did not attempt to do so.  Even using a flashlight all I could identify was the tweeter.  The grill is solid rather than being soft fabric you push in to find the drivers by feel.It comes with brackets for wall mounting.  Here is the back side:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was the center of the tweeter (aligned by eye). It is getting colder with the measurement room temp at 14 degrees C. Accuracy is better than 1% for almost entire audio spectrum indicating a well designed speaker.NOTE: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman products which includes Revel.  So feel free to read whatever bias you like in my subjective remarks.Revel C10 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:As you will see later, there is a built-in high pass filter so there is not much bass to speak of.  The rest of the response is well behaved though with a slight slope down.  There is some disturbance between 1 and 2 khz which is likely interference from the ports.  As noted before, I could not identify the location of said ports or midrange drivers so I have no near field measurements to confirm that.  Impact on frequency response is very modest though so should not mess up tonality.The good directivity gives almost textbook early window and predicted in-room responses:2-way versions of these speakers has had horribly narrow horizontal beam width.  The 2.5-way approach helps some here but doesn't solve the problem:You see the choke point around 1 to 2 kHz but it is twice as wide as competing speakers we have tested.Vertical directivity naturally is much better than most 2-way speakers:Impedance measurements show the high-pass filter with the way impedance shoots up as we get down to DC:That high pass filter pays dividends in keeping bass notes from causing a lot of distortion:It does make the relative amount look worse though but that is because there is essentially no response at lower range:I could feel the cabinet resonating strongly so we see that indicated in the waterfall display:Remember that I noted cabinet/port resonances between 1 and 2 kHz.  That is where we are seeing the bulk of resonances above.Finally, here is the impulse response for fans of this graph:Revel C10 Listening TestsAs soon as I started to play the C10, it sounded horrible.  Quick confirmation showed that I had the EQ on from last speaker test.    Turned that off and man, does this little speaker sound natural with great tonality.  Yes, there is no lower bass and the upper bass is a bit tubby as a result.  But the rest of the spectrum is beautiful with warm and correct tonality, very much similar to other well designed speakers I have tested (especially Revels).  I felt little need to create or mess with equalization.On dynamics ability, this was excellent due to not having any deep bass to bottom out the drivers.  I could get it loud enough to create some physical sensation in my belly and sudden notes were surprisingly impactful.  There is a lesson here is designing a speaker that is allowed to play only what it can do well.On directivity, changing one seat over caused a slight tonal shift in vocals but it was not at severe.ConclusionsThe Revel C10 gets us closer to what a tiny center speaker with multiple drivers should be.  Despite its budget class, clearly a lot of engineering has gone into making it deliver excellently smooth off-axis response (which summed).  High pass filter is smart although it makes it less than a full (spectrum) speaker.  If it had more bass, it would be a knock out.  But it doesn't.As a bonus, it is also quite small.  I put it in front of our flat panel and it disappeared below its standard stand.I am going to recommend the Revel C10.  If you can find it on the used market, it can be a great option compared to a lot of junk designs out there.  ----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Grill was not used.Unifi Reference UCR52 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Wow, I must say, I did not remotely expect to see such a rough frequency response.  It has both macro and micro level variations all over the place.  Near-field measurements of each sound radiating elements explains some of this:Notice the very uneven response of the coaxial driver.  We also have a port/cabinet resonance around 1 kHz.  Let me jump ahead and show you distortion response:When I was measuring the speaker I distinctly heard a sharp sound coming part way through the sweep.  Note that I wear strong hearing protection so normally don't hear problems with speakers unless they are very severe.  And this was.  I got close to the speaker and put my hand on the cabinet.  Right when I heard the output of norm, higher pitch sound, I would also feel the cabinet resonating.  This occurred with the 96 dBSPL sweep.  So I looked and saw that large peak between 500 Hz and 1 kHz.  So I created a sweep that only excited that range of frequencies and I could hear the tone again.Last time I reported a resonance like this it too was an a Elac speaker, the Unifi 2.0.  There was a lot of doubt then as to whether this was really there so I decided to make a recording of the sweep.  I used my phone to see if it can capture it and it did.  See the sample zip file.  Here is the amplitude evenelop:You can clearly see the amplification of the tone before the sweep ends.  If you play the audio file in an audio workstation software, you can easily hear the zing at the end in sync with that peak.I tested this at 86 dBSPL and it was harder to hear it there.Anyway, back to our measurements, here is our early window reflections:Response is thankfully smoothed out due to a number of reflections being summed but we still have a shelving of upper bass and midrange.  This results in the same issue in predicted in-room frequency response:Horizontal beamwidth is pretty uneven but fairly wide in mid-frequencies:Same is seen in the colored contoured version:There are sharp edges around the metal the surrounds the coaxial driver.  So I wonder it is causing some diffractions here that we see at the edge of our envelop.Strangely vertical directivity looks better even though it audibly is not as significant:I guess it doesn't have two woofers flanking it like the horizontal plane does.The three snapshots I take land in the sweet spot of the speaker so show good response:Impedance dips to 5 ohm so make sure you have a decent amplifier to drive this speaker:Note that our resonance shows up clearly here as well in both phase and amplitude response.Elac Uni-fi Reference UCR52 Listening Tests and EQHaving seen the measurements in advance, I expected poor sound but did not get it.  What was there was quite pleasant with very good dynamic ability.  Wondering if I had lost all ability to subjectively assess speakers, I went ahead and put in a couple of filters to deal with that step up response between 200 and 1000 Hz:At first, the difference was subtle but then I listened for 15 minutes and then turned off the EQ.  Wow, so much muddier and a bit tubbier without EQ.  Vocals came forward now which is what you want in a center speaker.ConclusionsI know the word ""reference"" has been bastardized in audio to almost mean nothing but still, I expected more, far more from Elac and Andrew Jones.  What were they thinking?  How could they produce such a technically flawed speaker?  When I can hear a resonance with hearing protection in a simple log sweep, surely they could too.  Do they only play at low and modest levels and don't hear such things?  If so, what is up with the uneven frequency response?  Is this all tuned by ear?  Why is it so uneven anyway?  Was this pushed out the door before being finished?  Lot of questions.Thankfully or not, in a battle of subjectivity vs objectivity, with a bit of EQ it performs a lot better than it should.  Dual woofers give it high SPL playback ability which is an effective way to get on my good side.    This is super important in home theater applications were the center speaker carries most of the burden as it has to show all that is seen on screen.On the resonance, I could not get a clear case of it showing up.  Either I was not playing loud enough or that the tone was getting added to other parts of the music and it was not as obvious as it was in Uni-fi 2.0.Anyway, I think technically the ELAC Uni-fi Reference UCR52 is a failure and I can't recommend it.  Subjectively, with some EQ it can be made to sound good.  You get to decide which side of me you want to believe.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is not intended to be a deep dive. Moreso, this is information for those who prefer “just the facts” and prefer to have the data without the filler.I reviewed the big brother JBL HDI-3800 floorstanding speakers here if you are interested in those as well.Information and PhotosNote: JBL was kind enough to loan me this item for test. I was not paid for my review and was not told what to say.The JBL HDI-4500 is 2.5-way center channel speaker. The below is from the manufacturer’s website:Designed and engineered in JBL’s world-famous acoustic engineering facility in Northridge, California, the HDI-4500 is the anchor of a complete HDI Series surround system. This center channel loudspeaker features a 2 ½-way design with patented High-Definition Imaging (HDI™) waveguide technology, the patented 2410H-2 1-inch (25mm) compression driver, and quadruple 5.25-inch (130mm) Advanced Aluminum Matrix cone woofers for powerful dynamics and incredibly accurate sound reproduction. The HDI-4500 enclosure is heavily braced to provide a solid acoustic foundation, and incorporates a bass reflex design with dual rear-firing, computer-optimized flared ports. The sophisticated curved cabinet features a modern design finished in a choice of automotive-grade painted High Gloss Black, or furniture-grade satin Walnut or Gray Oak wood veneers. A black cloth, magnetically attached grille completes the elegant appearance.​​MSRP for the single speaker is approximately $1750 USD.And here are some specs, again from the manufacturer’s website:CTA-2034 (SPINORAMA) and Accompanying DataAll data collected using Klippel’s Near-Field Scanner. The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker’s high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field. For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:A picture of the setup in my garage:The reference plane in this test is at the tweeter. The speaker was tested in ported configuration (the port was not sealed).All testing in this review was done without grille.The speaker was tested in the horizontal configuration (as it is expected this is how it will be used in the real world).Measurements are provided in a format in accordance with the Standard Method of Measurement for In-Home Loudspeakers (ANSI/CTA-2034-A R-2020).

The reason for this is to keep the same speaker quality between the entire front speakers so as dialogue/effects traverses one side to the other of the soundstage the sound “footprint” (if you will) remains the same. This is logical. However, this is typically not feasible unless you are using an acoustically transparent screen with a projection setup. The overwhelming majority of home theater enthusiasts do not have this luxury and instead opt to use a conventional center channel such as the one I have tested here. The issue with these kind of speakers is they are - essentially - floorstanding speakers, laid on their side. This orientation drastically changes the sound you hear at the listening position. Why does this happen? Well, as you can imagine, a single sound source such as a single woofer would have no effect as you turn it on its side because nothing about the radiation pattern changes; it is still that single woofer no matter how you turn it. A single woofer will not produce the full frequency range as well as a multi-way system (midwoofer+tweeter, midwoofer+midrange+tweeter, etc.). But a multi-way has issues of its own. As you incorporate more drive units into a speaker, the more susceptible a poor design is to poor sound. Those drive units have to go somewhere and you have to design a crossover network for them that allows the speaker to project sound in a radiation pattern that isn’t plagued with mismatches in directivity. Making a good horizontally-oriented center channel is tough. Especially for higher output capability. In order to manage these two you need multiple drive units with good horizontal and vertical directivity. The latter isn’t too hard. The former is. I say all of that to say this: when evaluating a horizontal center channel you know you are already starting with a disadvantage compared to a typical bookshelf or floorstanding speaker. As I said, if one is able, they should orient the center channel vertically (unless, in the rare case, the speaker is designed solely to be oriented horizontally).Now, with that critical caveat laid out, allow me to highlight some things I think will be useful to those who are considering or plan to purchase the HDI-4500:The on-axis response averages approximately 89dB @ 2.83v/1m.Linearity is pretty good here with a mild trough in the midrange relative to the 1kHz response. In terms of how this will sound, you can expect a mildly “hollow” midrange quality.The high-frequency linearity varies significantly above 9kHz. I believe these are diffraction effects of the waveguide with the proximity of the compression driver to the waveguide throat. How audible are these? Well, that’s a tough one to answer for me, at least. There is a 4dB dip at 10kHz in every angle. The narrow-Q shape and the fact that it is a dip lead me to believe it’s not much of an issue. From there the response picks up and peaks around 15kHz before peaking again at 20kHz+. I can’t provide a real assessment on this because I didn’t come across music that highlighted this, at least in a meaningful or noticeable way. Ideally the response would be more linear here.The low-frequency extension on this speaker is reasonable, in my opinion, for its size. In my listening tests I found it to pack a lot of “punch” but it didn’t dig very low and a good subwoofer crossed somewhere above the 60-80Hz region is my recommendation.You can see directivity changes at the stated crossover points of 600Hz and 2200Hz. Midbass-to-midrange and midrange-to-tweeter, respectively. The latter didn’t seem to be as much of a problem as the former which I get in to in the next bullet point.With respect to seating position, it is apparent that sitting more than ±20° to the side of this speaker results in a very recessed midrange quality.  The data shows this, notably in the horizontal globe plot by the orange/yellow area in the 300-800Hz region. (The other sets of horizontal SPL data show this, too.)   Listening to the speaker is no different in this regard.  There is a *noticeable* loss in speech intelligibility when sitting to the sides of the speaker at an angle greater than 20°.  However, if you do some napkin-math you can find that this limit is well-within most seating setups.  For example, if you are 8 feet from the speaker to the main listening position then using a maximum angle of 20° off-axis of the center channel means that your buddy/spouse/kid/dog can sit about 3 feet to the side of you.  That's reasonable.  At 12 feet from the center channel, the person next to you can sit a little over 4 feet from you.  That is feasible for most as well.  While the ±20° horizontal angle is my maximum off-axis recommendation, there is a loss in output in the 1-2kHz region at this angle.  The ±10° region provides a more uniform sound pattern but it is unlikely that this is achievable in most modern seating situations unless there is no listener directly on-axis.  Bottom line?  Stay within ±20° of the tweeter axis to the sides and you'll be OK.  Go beyond that and dialogue will suffer for off-axis listeners.Now, let’s look at the vertical response window. The vertical response window looks good between ±40-50° so while you would want to aim the speaker at the listening position, you have a bit more flexibility in positioning here. In other words, if you have to place the center channel below your TV in your living room, you’ll be OK as long as you tilt the speaker up and aim it toward your listening position. You have much more leeway here than you do in the horizontal axis.The impedance is stated at 4 ohm nominal. The impedance plot shows this to be quite true. I drove this with a Parasound 200 Integrated Amplifier with no issue (rated for 110w @ 4/8 ohm).Output levels. I drove this speaker hard for both music and movies and was able to achieve quite high output. Approximately 100dB at 12 feet with no mechanical issues (port noise, speakers bottoming out, etc.). Distortion on this speaker is also quite low.Support / ContributeIf you like what you see here and want to help me keep it going, please consider donating via the PayPal Contribute button located on my site.

It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs US $225.Sorry for low fidelity picture. It is from my mobile phone with the speaker mounted in test baffle. While build quality is good including a nice magnetic grill, the speaker felt fair light.  Here is the backside showing the crossover and such:As we would expect at these price points, there is nothing fancy going on here.  OK, they could have used a first order electronic crossover but they went to second order. Measurements were performed using special mode of Klippel Near-field scanner which eliminates back radiation and that of the room.  So it is equivalent to ""2 Pi"" anechoic measurement.  The tweeter is angled which creates a problem for measurements as the design of Klippel here calls for 0 degree (going into the driver).  I am able to however show the offset angle measurement as you will see later.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, caries Harman/JBL products for installation in custom designs.  So feel free to read as much bias as you like in my remarks.JBL Stage 280CSA MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our frequency response measurements.  As noted, this is perpendicular to the surface of the speaker and NOT along the angle of the tweeter:Clearly this is not a speaker you want to put above your head and expect uncolored response.  We not only have ups and down response but also a series of modulations above 6 kHz.  My guess is that the angled tweeter is causing reflections from the side of the speaker box which then comes back to interfere with the direct sound.  The frequency determines the phase of those reflections and whether they combine, destruct or something in between.  There is a nastiness around 5 kHz with a very sharp resonant peak.  We can see the cause of that in near-field measurements of each driver:That is one heck of a resonance to be even stronger than steady state response of the driver!  There is some possibility this could be due to the baffle amplifying it.  Still, it is a problem.  We also see the ups and downs in tweeter response although the point blank measurement reduces its impact some.To see if the response improves as we get closer to the tweeter angle and past, I selected three vertical measurements:It seems that the 40 degree alignment is the best.  You still need significant EQ to get a flat response but you are in better shape.I plotted the early window reflections even though they would not apply to a speaker mounted above:The reflections are out of phase with each other, producing a smoother treble response.  I don't want to post the predicted in-room response as it really doesn't apply here.Power handling is good as far as distortion is concerned (and me listening to sweeps in real time):As noted, if you want low distortion, you should cross this over at higher frequencies than typical 80 Hz.Minimum impedance in lower frequencies is a fair high (and hence good) of 7+ ohm:There is a very low point though around 10 kHz but signal content should be quite low there as to not upset the amplifier.Horizontal coverage is not great:Vertical response requires interpretation as it is at 0 degrees and not 40 degrees:It seems you better not go past 40 degrees or things get much worse.Here is the waterfall:That near 5 kHz resonance is quite strong, seemingly going forever.It doesn't make sense to listen to the speaker in an open baffle so I did not do that.ConclusionsThese angled tweeter designs are messy both to measure and interpret the results. They make intuitive sense to point the tweeter at the listener since the speaker itself can't be angled.  But in doing so one buys fair bit of grief in other artifacts such as comb filtering.  Simple crossover design doesn't get rid of a very pronounced resonance.  Lack of baffle compensation causes other oddities in frequency response.  Overall this makes for a mess tonality wise some of which can be forgiven by the rather low cost of the speaker.Overall, this is not a speaker I would want in my home theater.  So the search continues for a better design (I have a couple more to review).-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $495 (each). You can see it on the measurement stand:As an aside, this speaker was used in double blind test by the owner.NOTE: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman and hence Revel line.  While we don't do any retail business, I thought I let you know about that.  Of course the measurements are not subject to bias that way but you are welcome to read such in the rest of my commentary.I tested it as you see without the grill and with the tonality setting to 0.  Special ""baffle"" measurement was used in Klippel NFS which discards edge diffraction from the sides of the MDF baffle.  It also mathematically subtracts the back reflection, simulating what you get when you mount it on a larger wall than baffle I used.  As usual room reflections are removed as well.Revel W553L MeasurementsI was impressed by how clean the response was:Sensitivity is also quite high at nearly 90 dBSPL which should help a lot with dynamics of home theater application.  Overall response matches Harman data very closely which is good.Early window response is very good and only dragged down a bit vertically:This results in very good predicted in-room response:Near-field response doesn't show anything of concern:Beamwidth is naturally quite large in lower frequencies (due to infinite baffle) and controlled in higher frequencies:Directivity shows the same (ignore anything ± 90 degrees):Vertically we have the two holes due to MTM configuration so try to place/aim the speaker if you can for listener ears:Power handling is excellent for class:Impedance dips pretty low:Above is with baffle open.  In a wall it may change some.Finally here are the timing charts for those of you into them:ConclusionsI am not in a position to listen to this speaker since I have no wall to mount it in.  Going by the measurements, they look quite good.  Keep in mind that in-wall speakers are predominantly sold on the basis of how they look (with grill on) and how much margin they provide for the custom installer!  As such, a lot of terrible in-wall speakers are out there.  Revel however puts real engineering in them including double blind testing.  Measurements back careful attention to design with a speaker that would be at home competing with boxed speakers let alone other in-walls.Since I can't listen to the speaker I won't provide a recommendation.Edit: video review posted as well:-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,750 each.Note: our company Madrona Digital is a dealer with Harman and I suspect we have installed thousands of their in-wall products over the years.  While I have no way of shaping the measurements to favor one product or another, feel free to read any bias you like in my subjective words.As I had feared, I had to build yet another baffle to test the Revel as the last one I built for monoprice was a different size:I was out of wider panels. Ideally there would be more of a gap above and below the speaker for measurements.  Here is a back shot of it:The mounting studs are quite a bit more beefy than the ones monoprice used.  I was surprised that the capacitors were Revel branded.  They must have enough volume to justify getting custom caps like this.EDIT: the measurements you see are using a special method called Klippel NFS Baffle that is designed to get rid of limitations of measuring a speaker mounted like above.  It is able to get rid of diffraction caused by the edges of that baffle.  Importantly, it also gets rid of both room reflections and sound coming from the back of the speaker.  The result is a measurement that represents ""infinite baffle"" which you sort of get when you mount them in a large wall.I had to measure the speaker three times.  The challenge is that Klippel NFS in this type of measurement only allows one position to be specified which has to be the center of the radius encompassing the whole unit.  This point is at the suspension of the woofer and not where the sound field is most complex (tweeter).  As a result, the first scan produced mostly garbage above mid frequencies.  I upped this on the second scan, not realizing the boundary scan switch was on which screwed up the bass.    So a third scan had to be done.  Due to reference point not being the tweeter, the response is not reliable above 10 kHz:If you look all the way to the right, you can see how the measured and computed responses differ.  On the other hand, on the left we see the magic of Klippel NFS not only filtering out diffraction caused by the baffle edges, but also compensates for the back wave coming forward, causing cancellation.  The computed bass response takes this into account and as you see, shows the more proper bass which you would get when you mount this speaker on a wall.Revel W990 MeasurementsRemembering the above limitation and the reference being the upper part of the woofer surround, we get this:This is not the kind of response I expect to see from Revel and at this high price point.  I don't know if we have some measurement error or not.  Here is Revel's own spin graph:The dip around 150 Hz is there as well and so is the chewed up response of the tweeter.  But the level matching is better there in their measurements than mine.As noted, I also ran a test with the boundary compensation on (but at lower resolution):Here are the individual driver responses:Our early window and predicted in-room response is not designed for in-wall speaker but here they are anyway:Horizontal beamwidth is broad up to a point but then narrows beyond the surface of the wall:Ignore the response above 10 kHz per earlier note.I don't know why but Klippel software decided to switch to ±180 degrees for these two directivity plots:Some of you asked for this but I think it makes it harder to interpret the plots.  Anyway, keep the listening angle  within 30 degrees of vertical.Here is our 3-D directivity plots:Note that you only get what is to the right of the vertical line as the rest is behind the wall.  response is very good at 1000 and 2000 Hz.  3000 Hz may be screwed up due to baffle I built being too short vertically.There was really good news on distortion front:Note that these are in-room measurements so the on-axis response shown has the errors I showed earlier.  Then again, it does show the correct response for the > 10 kHz.Finally, here is our impedance and phase:The low impedance requires a good amplifier.ConclusionsMeasuring speakers this way is challenging.  Assuming we trust our measurements, the frequency response plots are not great.  I expect far better from Revel.  Maybe they know something about how these get used resulting in different tuning.  Sadly because I don't have a wall to mount them in, I can't tell you anything about the subjective results either.  Given what we have, and the high cost, I would not be buying these.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased new and sent to me by a member.  I believe he is using it for surround on-wall application (indoor) due to small dimensions of this speaker.  The retail cost for M55XC is $600 but there is a special (end of life?) going on bring the price for a pair down to US $420.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman and hence Revel speakers.  I don't know for a fact but we install a lot of outdoor Harman speakers in commercial and residential installations.  So feel free to read as much bias as you like into this review.This is a very compact speaker as outdoor ones usually are:There is sturdy metal grill that protects the drivers (which I did NOT use for measurements).  The back panel shows screw terminals which is more of a standard for outdoor speakers (a boot covers and waterproofs it):There is a plastic plug that you pull out where that dial is on the bottom to adjust the impedance for higher voltage drive to accommodate long speaker wire runs.  I tested it in the default mode which is for normal amplifier wiring.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker. Measurement axis is the tweeter center.Temperature was 78 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure. Since this is an on-wall speaker, it is likely designed to get bass enhancement from the wall behind it.  I could try to build some kind of wall to measure it that way but seemed too much work .  So what you see is the free-air measurement without such which will likely show lack of bass output.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:As we could have guessed, bass output is too low relative to tweeter when measured assuming no walls behind it.  Hard to then draw the trend line.  I took a shot at it which would naturally show the speaker to be ""bright"" lacking bass without wall enforcement of bass.Note how smooth the directivity is (dashed blue) line.  And freedom from resonances.  I have private measurements of a number of ""architectural"" speakers and they are generally horror shows.Early reflections then show similar response to on-axis:The rising directivity naturally reduces some of the highs making the response more flat.Putting the two together we get a predicted in-room response which says what we already know:Here is the impedance graph:Here is the response of the individual drivers:Speaker Dispersion MeasurementsLooking how wide of a beam the speaker projects without much loss of energy we get:We get a good 110 degrees with very smooth response.Same in 3-D:There are a lot of hi-fi speakers that fail to produce such an even response.And here is the vertical:Since you are wall mounting this speaker, this is an important measurement.  Point the speaker down and keep it withing -30 degree window.Speaker Distortion MeasurementsLet's look at our Klippel system measurements first:Looking at the left graph, we see that the not asking the little woofer to produce too much bass results in much lower distortion numbers.  Once you turn it up though, distortion climbs in the rest of the range (right).I should have captured the response at 86 dB but for consistency here is the distortion level at 96 dB:Switching to Audio Precision analyzer we start with loudness compression:This is very nice.  There is essentially no loudness compression even at 114 dBSPL @1 meter!  This speaker should play loud.Taking a deep dive into distortion relative to frequency, let's look at 86 dB SPL:And at multiple levels:Displacement which mostly happens in bass frequencies is our enemy when it comes to distortion and we see this once again in above chart.Finally here is our 32-tone test resembling ""music:""We actually beat our reference in above test.  Here is the comparison at two levels:Speaker Subjective Listening TestsI started testing with the M55XC in my usual location which is at least 4 feet from back wall and 3 foot from side wall.  Lack of bass was quite obvious so I moved the speaker back so that it has my system and Reel-to-Reel and TV behind it.  That nicely boosted the bass although the speaker was still a tad bright.  Proper placement on the wall would likely take that last bit away.I then went through my usual playlist and was shocked how closely the sound of this little ""outdoor"" speaker resembled my much larger home Revel speakers.  Clarity was superb.  Distortion was nowhere to be found even when I turned the volume up.  Indeed this speaker could handle incredible amount of power pumped into it without strain.  Not letting it produce too much bass helped a lot here.Tracks like this from Greek artist, Eleni Karaindrou's Medea album were to die for:Sadly I can't find an online stream to share with you.Another great performance (among many) was Patty' Griffin's Living With Ghosts Track, Cold As It Gets:Track after track impressed.ConclusionsI don't know what to tell you all.  I keep wishing there is a Revel speaker that doesn't perform so I can put it down and in the process look unbiased.  But I can't.  These things are designed so well, even in this utilitarian outdoor packaging.  Clearly similar design process is used for them as their home hi-fi gear (something Kevin Voecks of Harman confirmed with me years ago).  Using these of unobtrusive surround application indoor would be quite good as well as outdoor.  And there, the much higher cost can be justified easier.  Alternatively if you can place them against the wall, they will make very good ""bookshelf"" speakers.Alas, if they are being discontinued, then we are late to the party.   So better rush to get them.  I might do the same myself....Needless to say, I am very happy to recommend the Revel M55XC. -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Audio products that perform well always cheer me up so I don't need your money for that.

I am not sure how stable it will be as the 70J-1 did not want to sit by itself all that much.  So likely you need to mount these to a wall or something.  A bracket is provided to attach the two speakers together.As you see the 70JE-1 only has the bass drivers and lacks the ""J curve"" of the 70J-1. Since this is a bass module, I limited by scan to 8 kHz and used my usual 1000 point measurements.  Error rate was well below 1% up to 2 kHz which is way past or frequency of interest.  Measurement temperature was 60 degrees F.JBL CBT 70JE-1 MeasurementsLet's look at our usual spin data:Hmmm.  Bass response is quite peaky an uneven and different than what Harman shows in their brochure:In-room response confirms my measurements to be correct as seen in distortion plots:Distortion is low:Here is the 70JE-1 response overlaid on top of the spin for the 70J-1:As I am speculating on the graph, I wonder if the sum would then fill in the response below the peak resonance and give us something close to what Harman advertises?Harman only speaks of beam forming in the context of combining the two modules and how it can go lower in frequency now.  Here are my directivity plots:Vertical response is sure narrow but not constant.  Maybe it is in a narrow margin of 500 to 700 Hz?  I plotted that in at a few points:Looks like it is working.  At 300 Hz and below there is next to no control though as you get an omni response (not shown).Edit: here is the impedance:ConclusionsIt seems to me that 70JE-1 is more there to increase power delivery at lower frequencies than to provide much of any extension.  After all, it uses the same four drivers.  As it is, the baseline 70J-1 has excellent power capability.  I am imagine with the addition of 70JE-1, you get incredible amount of loudness.  I think the company advertises crazy numbers like 120 dBSPL!No, I have not had time to listen to the stack.  I don't want to go through the work of attaching them together.  I didn't export the data either as I am not sure how useful that is to have for a bass module.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

So feel free to read what you want into my subjective remarks (objective tests use the same protocol as any other speaker).As outdoor speakers go, the M80XC is on the larger size but attractively finished:Owner wanted it tested without the grill and this is how it looks:As you see a waveguide is used to better control the directivity (how wide the beam is) as woofer transitions to tweeter.  There are no ports as you see in the back:Variable impedance is provided so you can drive it at much higher voltages (to compensate for long runs of speaker wire).  And of course plenty of mounting options.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Using computational acoustics, far-field response is computed and that is what I present. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of about 1%. Clean high frequency response is responsible for ease of measurement in this regard.Reference axis is approximately the center of the tweeter. Grill was not used.Revel M80XC MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:On axis response is marred by drooping of the bass response and a couple of resonances.  Directivity is good though as we will confirm later.  We can see the cause of the resonances in driver response:Our off-axis response is actually better than on-axis:Overall though, there is insufficient bass for the amount of treble we have:Impedance and phase graph show one of the resonances:As noted, directivity is excellent:\This is almost studio monitor class directivity control!  This should make it produce wider response with similar frequency response and show less sensitivity to its environment.  Here is our 3-D baloon during the crossover transition showing good response:Vertically we have the usual issue with 2-way non-coaxial response so aim the speaker to where people's heads are:I don't know how but I got talked into now taking 4 SPL and distortion measurements:At 66 dBSPL distortion is actually below noise floor of the room in low frequencies.  And falls off the chart at higher frequencies.  As we increase the level, we see mainly the woofer distortion sticking out:Without a port, woofer is staying in control and not going above 100% THD.Here are the relative distortions for the last two levels:Revel M80XC Listening TestsI can't simulate outdoor listening indoor so I tested the M80 just like any other hifi speaker.  Out of the box, the sound is clear with highs accentuated.  Power handling is superb allowing me to get to ear bleeding levels with no hint of bottoming out. To get rid of the brightness, I used some EQ:The dialed in filters are quick and dirty but were enough to give the speaker more substantial bass and tamed the brightness.  The narrow resonance fix had a very subtle effect.  Once there, I could enjoy these speakers as if there were truly hi-fi speakers with no reservations.  Indeed they would beat many bookshelf speakers out there!ConclusionsThere is definitely care in design of the Revel M80XC for a market that usually doesn't consider such.  Cost, looks and dealer margins rule there.  If the tuning had more bass and/or less highs, this would be a fantastic speaker regardless of application.

It was kindly purchased new and shipped to me by a member.  It costs US $1047 on Amazon including free delivery.  You can get it in black or white colors.Note: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and hence JBL.  We have actually installed a number of these speakers in commercial applications.  See: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ransducer-speakers-in-commercial-project.310/.  You may also want to assign as much bias as you feel necessary for the subjective aspects of this review.Other than being tall and narrow, little hints at the unusual design of this speaker:There are four low frequency drivers and whopping 16 high frequency ones:Using ""shading control"" the drivers work together to limit vertical dispersion to the height of the speaker.There are two settings on the unit as you can barely see on the right bottom of the speaker above.  One sets the width, I choose wide, and the other, ""music or speech.""  I naturally selected music.  JBL documentation shows these settings create the flattest response.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 2000 measurement which resulted in error rate below 2% up to 10 kHz or so.  Above that, error shoots way up so the response there is not correct.  I could use more points but as is, it took nearly 5 hours to measure and created a 1.5 gigabyte measurement file!Testing temperature was around 60 degrees F.I could not see through the grill to pick a ""reference axis"" and wouldn't know where that would be anyway.  So for measurements, I just picked a more or less center location on the flat part of the speaker.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.JBL CBT 70J-1 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Harman includes spin data that shows much flatter response than above.  Specifically there is no sign of that resonance in their measurements.  But it is in every aspect of my measurements.  I even heard it during the sweep!  The level went up and then back down in the middle.  We can see evidence of resonance in waterfall display:And evidence of even more of then in impedance and phase graph:I could also see it in the 'in-room"" distortion measurements:Speaking of distortion, it is extremely low:Sure, it doesn't attempt to play very low but what it does play is very clean.Efficiency is the highest I have measured of any speaker I have tested, clocking at 92 dB or so.Early window reflections are very good:Notice how the ceiling reflections - dashed red - are at so much lower level due to beam forming produced by CBT technology.  Floor reflections are not that much reduced though.Our predicted in-room frequency response is very good, sans that resonance:Horizontal directivity is wide and not controlled a lot:Vertically, it is another game altogether:This thing is a shaft of sound coming at you!  Vertically directivity control is definitely there.Edit: here are two 3D graphs which should help with understanding of how the sound field is shaped to be a horizontal donut as opposed to sphere:Listening TestsThe efficiency advantage came through immediately as soon as I played my first track through the CBT J70-1.  I could barely turn up the volume before the speaker would fill my large space with ease.  Turn it up even more and it can get scary loud with no hint of distortion!  Granted, deep bass is not there but everything above that plays with incredible efficiency and dynamics.Tonality was very good but I thought I take down the resonance peak with EQ:The difference was subtle.  The sound was more open now, more detailed and slightly less harsh.  Once there, I sat and listened and listened!  It was an incredible experience.If you have not ever heard a CBT speaker, it is something altogether different.  You can walk up to it and level barely changes.  Ditto for going back or even moving horizontally.  It can almost be called ""constant level speaker!""  You feel like you are freed from sitting like a statute in a fixed spot.  You can walk around a large area and overall response of the speaker barely changes.  It is so uncanny and what I experienced when I listened to these at Harman years ago.  They had them in this massive airplane hanger type building.  Yet these were filling them with so little drop off in level as you walked forward and back.While these speakers are a natural for outdoor use, they also make great surround speakers. They solve the issue of the people sitting to the sides hearing too much of the surround speaker closest to them.ConclusionsI must say, while I expected to hear the nice experience of CBT beam forming, I did not expect the speaker to sound so correct tonally.  And be so efficient and effort-free.  With just that bit of EQ, you have a very high performance speaker.  They need bass enforcement though.  I have the companion lower half of this speaker which I will test next.I am going to strongly recommend the JBL CBT 70J-1.  You need to hear one to open your vista of what is possible with a bit of complex math.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a local member and costs US $160 from Amazon including free shipping.Fit and finish doesn't look bad and I especially like the beefy bracket:There is a cover that hides the speaker connections in the back.An article in Wirecutter which was syndicated by NY Times voted the AP650 as their ""best outdoor speaker.""  It goes on to say: https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-outdoor-speakers/""Its clarity beats anything we’ve heard from other models priced under $200 per pair, and it has a full, powerful sound that can easily fill a typical suburban backyard. It has enough bass for R&B, hip-hop, and rock music, and its relatively high sensitivity lets it deliver loud volumes when paired with a small amplifier. ""It was a bit difficult to measure this speaker because it doesn't want to sit upright by itself.  I propped it up as best as I could be it may have measured a couple of degrees leaning back.  Also, I left the grill on and had to locate the tweeter with a flashlight.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Well, this is not a pretty sight.  Just about everything is messed up from on-axis to directivity and overall tonality.  Granted, you may not listen to this on-axis but still, hard to find anything to hang your hat on.Crossover seems to be the problem here as indicated in the near-field measurements:Woofer response remains very high way past crossover region.  This leads to high distortion there as well:Early window and predicted in-room response don't quite apply to a speaker that is wall mounted but still useful data:Impedance is reasonably high which is good:Directivity as noted is horrid:We have both beaming of the tweeter above 8 kHz and mismatch with woofer starting at 2 kHz.OSD AP650 Listening TestsThe sound can only be described with two words: hollow and bright!  All you hear is this brightness with zero body to the sound.  I lowered the highs with EQ and boosted the 1 to 3 kHz and that made some improvement.  But really, there is no proper sound coming out of this speaker to be worth messing with.   So I stopped.ConclusionsThe outdoor speaker business is all about marketing and margins.  Technical correctness is not even in the vocabulary of most manufacturers.  This could have been an exception seeing how the praise had come from a technical reviewer (Brent Butterworth).  I can't fathom how he thought this speaker was worth listening to.  OK, I can.  Maybe all the others he tested were much worse which would not surprise me.  Needless to say, I can't recommend the OSD AP650.  Buy this speaker if you want some noise outside not high-fidelity experience.  Even then, you may be told to ""turn it down"" after it gets to your guests with its high pitched sound.   Or else point it up or something.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $409 (each).In discussion with the owner, we decided to measure and review the speaker without its grill:The grill is metal and is fastened by two screws in the center (covered by a JBL logo) and then very well friction fit all around.Back panel is all industrial showing the option to also drive the speaker using high voltage (to reduce cable losses in very long runs):As you see, there are plenty of options for wall and stand mounting.  The enclosure is rugged but not super heavy thick stuff.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Using computational acoustics, far-field response is computed and that is what I present. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of about 1%. Clean high frequency response is responsible for ease of measurement in this regard.Reference axis is approximately the center of the tweeter. Grill was not used.JBL Control 29AV-1 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Gosh, what a good response until we get to 900 Hz. Messiness there is due to what the front mounted port produces:You can also see the cause of the higher frequency unevenness being the tweeter.  Early window reflections -- assuming it corresponds to your situation -- is messy:This in turn screws up the predicted in-room response:Distortion is very much under control in bass where it is usually a mess in small outdoor speakers:Something is amiss in the tweeter though:Beamwidth is nicely controlled although on the  narrow side (which may be a good thing for outdoor far listening):Vertical is also smooth but don't go too far above or below the tweeter axis:Zooming into three frequencies in middle bands, we see the problem with the port spitting out stuff at the same time as the woofer:But then becomes happy as the tweeter takes over.Impedance is reasonably high which is good although dips low in high frequencies:Where it dips is where we have peak distortion.  Hmmm....JBL Control 29AV-1 Listening TestsI tested the JBL like any other hi-fi speaker indoor in my usual far-field listening space.  Let's get the good news and easy answer out of the way first: this thing can play and scale up without any sign of strain.  The combination of the port and bass driver is doing its job well as the measurements show.The rest is not easy.  I did not fall in love with the speaker and my quick attempts at EQ were mixed.  On some content it sounded better, on others did not. I did get the sense that reducing the resonances around 1 kHz was helpful but subtle.  There was some high frequency shrillness that was very content specific.  I pulled down one of the peaks there and that helped but again, not sure in balance it was a good idea.I tested sub-bass reproduction but hardly anything came out the speaker.  Likely the reason it is able to scale up in playback level; it doesn't do what it can't do.Where does it net out?  I don't know!  Some speakers are harder to assess and this is one.ConclusionsThere is some goodness in this design: ability to play loud with little distortion in bass.  The variability above that is too complex for me to quantify with listening tests.  It certainly is not awful or objectionable most of the time.  With respect to outdoor speaker standards, this is a very capable speaker.  With respect to using it as a pure hi-fi speaker, I am stomped per above.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: If that ditch wasn't there around 300 Hz and there was not a tilt up response, it would have been darn good!  Near-field response shows good design when managing port/enclosure resonance:Not sure why the tweeter drops so much though above 10 kHz.Early window math is not made for mounting this against the wall:Ditto for predicted in-room response:Distortion is kept surprisingly under control at 86 dBSPL:I could hear some amount of bass distortion during the sweeps at 96 dBSPL but it was much lower than many powered monitors.Impedance is reasonable at minimum of 5 ohm:I was shocked how well controlled beam width and hence directivity is in horizontal axis:This puts many professional monitors to shame!Vertically even it is better than it would be although some of the credit goes to the smaller woofer in use here:JBL Control X Speaker Listening Tests and EqualizationI was so impressed by the female reference tracks I use for my testing.  In far field setting, the Control X sounded downright beautiful!  The resolution and clarify together with tonality were on the money.  Moving to bass heavy tracks though took the bloom of the rose some.  Good news was that deep bass did not upset it.  Nor did volume.  Despite being so little, I was able to pump sound into my massive room with no difficulty!  On some tracks, there was more brightness than I like as predicted by the measurements.  But you could live with them.I took a shot at EQ but from past experience, I know that dealing with bass response is tricky as the room massively modifies that.  Such was the case here:I think it is a toss up as to whether these settings are an improvement or not.  Will need to make in-room measurements and correct the combination.ConclusionsI had very low expectations going into this review.  Plastic speaker selling for $99/pair?  Surely that can't sound good.  But clearly it does when a ton of thought and design goes into it as opposed to pure marketing which the outdoor speaker business is all about.  Indeed these speakers are so good that you could get a pair and use them on your desktop.  You would need a sub to get full-range response but otherwise, this is definitely a contender.I am going to recommend the JBL Control X for both indoor and outdoor applications.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was purchased new by a member and kindly drop shipped to me.  The retail cost seems to be over US $400 (each!) but I see it on sale for US $300 or so.  One site says it is now replaced with a newer model.Outdoor speakers are usually sold to the custom install (CI) industry.  It is a very competitive market with the top feature often being how much margin there is for the dealer!  Needless to say, many corners are cut to get such high margins for the channel.  Trying to compete with a quality speaker is hard.Anyway, from the outside the Focal looks like any other outdoor speaker:The back panel shows better binding posts than typical but that is it:But maybe it is better quality plastic that won't yellow over time.FYI the owner wants to use these for Atmos indoor rear speakers due to availability of mounting hardware.  It is tough to do that with typical hifi speaker whereas here you have ready to go brackets and screws in the back.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used 800+ measurement points which was not quite enough for upper frequencies resulting in error that approaches 2% instead of my usual target of 1%.Temperature was 71 degrees.

I left the grill on as this is their typical use mode.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: There is some jaggedness which is likely caused by reflections from the grill.  I like the overall flatness of the response from upper bass to lower mid-range.  Bass though is accentuated some which is probably good for the target application.  Don't like the tweeter going crazy as we get above 10 kHz.Directivity is generally smooth which means you can use equalization to improve the response if needed.Early window response is a bit chaotic:Putting the two together calms things down though:While I have liked a bit of bass boost in the past, this may be a bit much causing boominess.  And the tilt of the response seems a bit shallow so perhaps it will sound a bit bright.Driver response shows two fault areas:Impedance dips really low so best to have good amplification:We also see the resonances causing the two problem areas.Distortion is quite high in bass:We have a little plastic box here so hard to expect a lot better.Horizontal dispersion seems very good:Vertically is chewed up though so you need to make sure you are not below the tweeter axis:Otherwise you fall in that ""blue eye"" and loos fair bit of response in 2 to 4 kHz.Speaker Listening TestsInstant impression with no EQ was ""boy this sounds boomy.""  I turned on my usual room mode filter for 100 Hz and that helped at the cost of some loss of bass.  Going through a bunch more tracks, the boominess remained so I used the Predicted-in-room response and decided to lower the upper bass even more:That cured the boominess but at the cost of amount of bass.  A few times I liked it better with no EQ.During the testing there was some lisping especially in female voices but even in some male vocals.  I tried many filters but at the end I gave up.  It is not a huge problem but it is definitely there.Bass handling was excellent in that it would not bottom out (with or without EQ) even on my ""speaker killer"" tracks.  And the mid-range response was good to excellent.ConclusionsThe Focal OD 706V is definitely a huge step above typical outdoor speaker.  It plays louder and has a much more balanced response than many.  Alas, if compared to other hifi speakers, there is definitely compromises.  Fortunately the main issue which is the bass can be corrected in EQ and at any rate, is highly modified due to room response.  In my case it landed on top of the room mode I already have so perhaps my case is tougher than normal.Overall, I went back and forth on whether I should or should not recommend it.  I simply could not decide.  It is too good in many respects to say no.  But clearly has some bothersome attributes that keeps me from saying ""go and buy it"" without reservations.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.

Polk specs this as 89 dB.  That is only true of the peak output of the tweeter.  Bass response at best is 85 dB dropping to 82 dB so quite insensitive.  We see the response variation in near-field measurement of each driver:Perhaps they are counting on back wall enhancement of the bass region.Our early window and predicted in-room response don't quite apply to a speaker mounted to a wall outdoor but here they are anyway:Beamwidth is uneven:It is not too bad up to 10 kHz though so maybe in practice, it would be better than it seems.Vertical directivity is typical:Impedance is low:I was surprised at low level of distortion at 86 dBSPL:Polk Atrium 4 Listening TestsI first had them on a stand away from walls, i.e. same place I test all speakers.  The sound was almost all tweeter.  So I placed it in front of my LCD TV and that brought in much needed bass response.  On some tracks it was a bit boomy but otherwise, what you heard was exaggerated highs but pretty clean.  I think this is due to the exaggeration being at the top of the frequency range and distortion being low.  Try as I did, I could not hate the sound.  A lot of power was required to get good volume.  Good news was that the sound was clean with no break up when I was pushing it.  Sub-bass did not impact the speaker due to its sealed design.ConclusionsClearly this is an imperfect design both objective and subjectively.  It might however work better in its intended application of being mounted on a wall and not listened to necessarily on-axis.  It definitely sounds better than a driver in cheap plastic box.I can't bring myself to put the Polk Atrium 4 on my recommended list but per above, I could not hate it either.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Good news is that frequency response on axis is pretty flat in the all important region between 200 and 3 kHz.  Bad news is that there is significant peaking in high frequencies and directivity (how the waveform beam of the woofer and tweeter match) is poor in the crossover region.Early window reflections are a bit better and naturally apply if you use the speaker indoor in stereo setup:Using the same assumptions, this is our predicted response:I had little idea how to draw that trend line.  Either way, there is too much high frequency energy.Here is the near-field measurements of the tweeter and woofer:The tweeter peaking is not very visible.  This could be due to offset measurement of that driver at less than half inch distance from it.Impedance dips to 5 ohm which is better than 4 ohm or lower we typically see:Distortion is fairly high:Interesting sudden peaking above 7 kHz.  Seems like the tweeter is getting unhappy there.As noted, directivity is not very good:Speaker Subjective Listening TestsI went into the listening tests thinking this would be a bad sounding speaker given the peaking in highs, high distortion and directivity error.  Such was not the case.  Yes, on a lot of content it did sound bright but linearity of the response elsewhere allowed it to have good tonality.  Certainly my ""hifi tracks"" sounded hifi.I decided to cure the brightness with a quick EQ but it was not fully successful:My Roon DSP doesn't have an easy to use target curve module so I had to do with that shelving filter.I put in my usual dip for the room mode.  This was a mix blessing as you do want some room enforcement here.  Overall, I liked that it didn't sound too tubby at the cost of some bass.I also put in a high pass filter and that really reduced distortion resulting in more open sound.  Bass loss was minimal.Once there, speaker response was very good as was power handling.  It was hard to make the unit fall apart even at very elevated levels.  Surprising to be sure as that held even without my EQ.ConclusionsObjectively and superficially, it would be easy to dismiss this speaker as not being good.  But subjectively and especially with EQ, the Outsider II sounds very good and can be put in use in home hifi use in addition to its outdoor applications.As such, I am going to put the RSL Outsider II on my recommended list.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Sometimes it pays to overdue something.  Such is the case with tomatoes in our climate.  Despite the battering of rain as of late and much colder climate, we still had enough of these pear and plumb tomatoes to fill a nice box:Had the golden pear tomatoes with tuna salad for lunch and boy where they sweet and tasty!Beside these, we harvest another 50 to 60 pounds of melons, peppers, zucchini, eggplant, etc.  It is getting close to the end of the season so we are pulling what all we can and have room for.Back to misery around the house, the plumbers showed up to put in a new pipe in the septic tank to make it easier to unclog next time.  What was supposed to be a 1 hour job or less, wound up being 3 hours.  The experienced plumber sent junior down who could not pull out the pipe, only to discover 2 hours later that there were two extra bolts holding the flange.  Thankfully I had negotiated a fixed $900 price.  Not so thankfully, they discover that the pipe leading to the tank is lower than the inlet so stuff accumulates in there causing a clog.    Now I have to have my helper come to dig a trench and for these guys to come back and run a new 6 foot pipe for hundreds of dollars more!Tempting to do the work myself but who wants to deal with all that dirty sewage?

It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $650.NOTE: as you will see later, this is a special review with far more detail than I usually show in a speaker test.  I thought it would be ""fun"" to see much more extensive treatment of these speakers.  Result was three full days of measuring, processing, processing again and again, generating slides, generating those again, and again.  I hope you appreciate the extra work that has gone into this review and no, I won't be doing this with future reviews.   Given the detail level, this is not for a casual reader of these reviews.  As such, feel free to skip to subjective listening results and conclusions.I was thankful for the thin and relative light weight of the LRS when I went to measure it and carry it to my listening room:As you can sort of tell from above picture, there are two panels side-by-side.  One to the left with wider size and traces and the other handling higher frequencies with much narrower width.  Per feedback from membership, I selected the measurement axis/point as being more or less where the ""X"" mark is in red (center of the panel).  Alas, I had to empirically move this [position (in software) as you will see later.  I wanted the center of that axis to be on the tweeter but the auxiliary stand that I built was symmetrical and wouldn't allow me to go close to the right.You see an indentation toward top.  This is not normally visible but the reason for it is a large button screw that holds the panel down (I think).A set of metal stands forces a some amount of lean back which I find surprising.  By dropping a couple of rings, you can tilt the speaker less and is something that is recommended by the company if listening past 10 feet or so.  I was worried about measuring the speaker so leaning back in its default position  so I tiled it up mostly to the angle that would be if you used the secondary, more upright position.I was fortunate enough to get a preview measurement that was performed by Klippel distributor in US, Warkwyn labs which was published in AudioExpress magazine.  My measurements match theirs although the results as presented are different due to some improvements I made as you see later.Warkwyn measurements showed that the Klippel system was struggling to characterize the sound field despite using over 2000 measurement points.  I was going to use more measurement points only to realize it would take 5 hours just to do the 2000 point measurement!  It was really strange to watch the system make a vertical set of measurements and move a millimeter and do that all over again!  The tall speaker meant there was a lot of time lost moving up and down, lengthening measurements.Not only was the measurement time long, but so was processing the 1.5 Gigabyte file to compute the sound field and various measurements.  Computational time was in the order of half hour.Klippel NFS Measurement AccuracyAs most of you hopefully know, the Klippel NFS makes a series of near-field measurements (in order to benefit from better signal to noise ratio) and then using those points, solves the partial differential equations that describe the wave propagation.  Once there, we are able to predict the sound field in any point in space in the far field (where we more or less listen).  The technique while wonderful, has limitations in that if the sound field becomes too complex, it requires many more measurement points and ""orders of expansion.""  Despite using high measurement points used per above (more than 2X of any speaker I have measured), the sound field was too complex in high frequencies to get accurate readings.  Klippel is able to determine the error by making additional ""real"" measurements that it then compares to what it has computed.  The difference is expressed in dB of error.  Usually the results are below -20 dB indicating 1% error in most or all of the audible band.  That was not the case here:In theory, this should NOT have happened.  Lay intuition about this speaker is that they are two vertical drivers each sending out a perfect plane wave of their own.  Reality is different in that there are clearly other sources of sound interfering with each other, creating a highly complex wave front.  Fortunately, the error is not high enough to distort what we are interested in.  Here is a Klippel graph showing the actual versus computed response at a certain point:Focusing on the right, the actual measured response was in red but the blue is what is computed.  As you see, as the frequencies go higher, error increases but fortunately it still more or less follows the response of the speaker which is dropping like a rock above 10 kHz or so.Speaker Radiation PatternNormally I lead with our spinorama measurements but here, I thought we work backward and first look at the directivity of the speaker.  Here it is in the horizontal axis.  That is, you are facing the speaker and the graph shows what happens 360 degrees around the speaker:Being a dipole speaker, the LRS radiates what you see in the front, in the back.  The back response however is split into two halves (top and bottom of the graph) so not as intuitive.  But hopefully you see it now with the annotations in place.  We have a nice constant beam width up to low treble and then the pretty picture corrupts:The notch around 1 kHz in directivity is due to offset nature of the tweeter panel.  I have the ""right"" speaker so the treble has baffle amplification on the left but not right.  At least this is what I assumed when I created the slide but I am not sure the tweeter is active there.  Open to ideas from readers.The most interesting part and what cost me a lot of time and effort was the vertical dispersion:Yes, as you go above 1 kHz or though, the speaker starts to beam hugely, creating a super narrow angle of +- 10 degrees where you get the full response.  Go up or down below this and you have massive loss of high frequencies.  Indeed that is what I had when I first measured the speaker as did the Warkwyn plots.  So I started to adjust the reference axis higher and higher until I got it in that sweet spot. Spinorama Speaker MeasurementsHere is our standard graph now:To give you an idea of the response was before I changed it, here it is:You basically get no highs or low! Both graphs show odd modulations of on-axis response above 3 kHz as indicated by the jagged peaks.  And the fact that this speaker doesn't generate much sound until you get to 300 Hz or so.One of the ""benefits"" of a line source of this type is that you get little radiation above and below the speaker.  We can see some of that effect in the early window and the levels of the floor and ceiling reflections:And here is our predicted in-room response:There was no good way to draw the trend line given the large drop in bass response.  But I tried anyway.Sound Field VisualizationsLet's get fancy and look at how the sound propagates from the LRS first in horizontal plane.  I can only show this at one frequency at a time so let's start with 500 Hz or so that is squarely in the domain of the main low frequency panel:The color shows sound pressure level (red the highest, blue the lowest).  We see a wave front radiating from the driver.  Now let's step up to 2.2 kHz:If my interpretation is correct, we now have both drivers radiating and creating interference patterns.  Going to 10 kHz isolates just the tweeter:The tweeter panel is the right but we also get images on the left side of the speaker.I also analyzed a vertical slice but this time, I will just show a static picture (above animations were a lot of work to create):Imagine you are standing on the right looking into the speaker.  We see that the radiation pattern on the back and front follow the tilt axis of the speaker as it was measured.  Also indicated clearly is that we have a narrow range of radiation before we hit pockets that are nulls or have less power (no red color in them).  These interference patterns must be due to multiple sources playing at once and creating the complex sound field I talked about at the start of the review.Speaker Distortion MeasurementsAt the original point I was measuring the speaker, the highs were very low and as such, I could not get the LRS up to 86 dB let alone 96 dB.  Here are what I got anyway:Distortion seems to be very much in control at higher frequencies.Notice how rough the in-room response is where I measured the speaker.Impedance MeasurementsElectrically panel speakers like LRS are simple resistive loads:Impedance dips down to 3 ohm so you better have an amplifier with good current capability.  The phase though is nearly zero.  The vertical scale is only 20 degrees and hence the visually large variation.  Transition to Far FieldKlippel computers the response of the speaker and can show at what point we are approaching far field of the speaker.  For LRS and at frequencies of 400 Hz and higher, that is 3 meters or 10 feet.   So better not sit too close to them:Subjective Speaker Listening TestsI first positioned the panel right at me and started to play.  What I heard sounded like it was coming from a deep well!  I then dropped the little rings on the stand and repositioned the speaker as you see in the picture (less toed in).  That made a big difference and for a few clips I enjoyed decent sound.  Then I played something with bass and it was as if the speaker was drowned under water again.  It wasn't just absence of deep bass but rather, quietness on top of that.Even when the speaker sounded ""good"" you would hear these spatial and level shifts that was really strange.  As the singers voice changed tonality, it would sometimes shift left and right.  And change in level no doubt due to uneven frequency response.  There was also some strange extended tail to some high frequency notes that would seem to go on forever.  Just when I thought I had the speaker dialed in, I leaned back some and the tonality got destroyed.  You had to sit in the proverbial vice around your head to get the ""right"" sound out of LRS.I applied a quick and dirty inverse fix to the response to get some semblance of neutrality:The one PEQ shown, combined with an overall lift of the entire response made a huge difference.  Speaker was no longer dull, lacking both bass and treble.  Alas, after listening some, the highs got to me so I put in the right filter to fix that.  And while the LRS could handle the boost in low frequencies well, bringing for the first time some tactile feedback, it did start to bottom out so I had to put that sharp filter for extreme lows.Once there, I was kind of happy until I played the soundtrack you see at the bottom.  Man did it sound horrid.  Bland and some of the worse bass I have heard.When it did sound good -- which was on typical show audiophile tracks -- the experience was good.  Alas, every track would sound similar with the same height and spatial effects.ConclusionsThe Magnepan LRS is a hugely flawed speaker with moments of delight.  If I could control what you listen to, e.g. in an audio show or dealer room, I could convince you it is much better speaker than it is.  The best way I can explain this is that the designers solved 30% of the physics of building a speaker, and threw you in there to solve the rest!  You take on the job of spending what must be a lifetime messing with location, tilt, EQ, etc. to get sound that is good for more than a few select tracks.I am confident a better job can be done than what we see in LRS.  Maybe making the panels smaller causes the beaming and interference patterns worse.  I don't know.  What I do know that this is not a product finished and fit for use by a consumer.  I wonder how much simulation and in field analysis was performed as I have shown here.  Doesn't seem like much was done to find and remove issues with this speaker.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Magnepan LRS.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Have to go and see if I can fix our dishwasher now.

It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me (back in spring no less!).  They cost US $130 a pair on Amazon including Prime shipping.  I think I found it elsewhere for just US $99 which is quite a low price for a 3-way speaker.The pair of of NS-6490 come in a giant cardboard box because each speaker itself is far bigger than just about any bookshelf speaker you have seen:Doesn't this look pretty and utterly marketable?  Makes you think you are buying the famous Yamaha studio monitors with their white drivers. Some of your dreams are dashed when you lift the speaker and notice that it is incredibly light especially for its size.  Part of that has to do with very thin walls:I must say, it has been decades since I have seen spring terminals on a speaker like this.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 800 measurement which resulted in error rate of slightly above 1% in the upper treble frequencies.Temperature was 59 degrees F (yes, it is getting cold here). Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.With the offset tweeter, it was not convenient to set that as the tweeter axis. So I made the executive decision to pick a point between the mid-range and tweeter for that.Yamaha NS-6490 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Man, do we have flaws!  Have we measured a speaker with this bad of an on-axis response?  I don't remember.  From what I have read, the woofer is driven direct and only an electrolytic cap is used for each of mid-range and tweeter drivers.  So they all bleed into each other's range causing rising amplitude.Narrow peaking in the response which shows up in all the upper graphs indicates resonances (something having a life of its own when activated) and we have more of them than I have ever seen.  It is like having nearly a dozen little speakers turning on and off all the time.You can see evidence of resonances just the same in impedance and phase response:Early reflections are flatter but not really flat:Predicted in-room response shows the flaws we have already predicted:Beamwidth is highly variable indicative of no control:Looks like my guess with respect to reference axis was correct:Distortion is high as well:Yamaha NS-6490 Listening TestsYoutubers would go crazy if they tested this speaker: ""wow, how detailed!""  Well, it is detailed because it has hyper elevated response above a few hundred hertz.  It sounds just like it measures.  I brought down a number of peaks in the response and that made it somewhat reasonable to listen to.  But whether it was resonances or distortion, it would still sound bright.Power handling was good until it catastrophically was not.  A loud static was heard as I pushed up the volume.  You get no notice up to that point so I suggest not overamplifying this speaker.ConclusionsIf you were to throw away everything we know about how to produce a proper sounding speaker, and amped up the best marketing and industrial design you could get, you would arrive at the Yamaha NS-6490.  In a showroom its bright nature will likely sound good for a a minute or two before you pull out the credit card.  Searching I see some mods online.  It may be a fun project to mess with it although you won't get rid of the resonances without a lot of work and expense.It pains me to give the Yamaha NS-6490 as it really looks good to me.  But I just can't recommend it.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome. Harvesting fruits and vegetables at the scale we have was always a pain.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Ignoring the three prominent peaks, on-axis response is actually quite flat.  The cause of those peaks is quite evident if we measure each radiating surface at close distance:Starting at the right, the tweeter is clearly peaking at around 15 kHz.  Coming down we see the peak around 1.3 kHz which I think is caused by the port resonance (orange).  There is another peak around 870 Hz which may be from the woofer itself or combination with the port.Early window reflections show quite a similarity (for good or bad) with the direct on-axis sound:Putting the two together gives us a predicted response that is slightly smoothed over version of on-axis:From experience I know that the peaking from 900 to 2 kHz can actually be pleasant and far better than dips in that area.  The final resonance likely is not very audible due its very high frequency and narrowness.Here is our impedance plot which shows the resonances as well:The fancy trademark JBL waveguide does it job well in controlling directivity:These are active, professional monitor class directivity and not something we often see in bargain speakers.I was pleased that we had more wiggle room vertically, making the height of the speaker less critical:Most impressive was the low amount of distortion:If those resonances were not there around 1 kHz and at 15 kHz, this would look even cleaner.We can see our 50 dB reference line is barely exceeded until we get very low in frequency.  Did not expect this.JBL A130 Listening TestsI started to listen to the A130 as is and as I suspect, the sound was pretty pleasant.  Yes, the upper mid had the accentuation that I expected.  This actually makes female vocals sound more detailed and more airy.  But it was a bit much so I reached in my EQ tool and knocked those two resonances down plus the one at 15 kHz:Not only did the first two notches clean up the response but it made the sound of the speaker super clean and effortless.  There was a level of fidelity that was giving me goosebumps!  I can only envision the cause being reduced distortion to go alone with the better response.  The third filter made a very subtle difference but was still worthwhile.Once there, I started to crank up the volume and this little speaker can play and play loud!  Despite me using a single speaker, it had no trouble playing as loud as I wanted.  My speaker killer track with deep bass and zero effect on it.  Bass played as if it is no big deal producing a level of fidelity that I rarely see, err hear, in speakers let alone a budget one.ConclusionsOut of the box the JBL A130 gets a lot of things right but leaves us with basically two resonances that are issues.  Fortunately the peaking there is not as bad as it seems to the eye.  As it was the A130 was more than listenable.  Dial in the simple EQ as I did and this speaker outperforms many speakers.  It has a fluid, effort-free sound with excellent neutrality that was a joy to listen to across all kinds of music.  It simply did not care what I threw at it -- it performed.I can recommend the A130 even if you don't have an EQ.  If you can apply EQ, then the JBL Stage A130 gets one of my highest recommendations.  It is a great example of how we can fix one or two minor flaws in a speaker with EQ and create a hybrid solution that is nearly untouchable in its price range or even higher.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Had stored the last batch of Japanese shishito peppers saved up and figured I make a snack out of them:With a touch of lemon juice, soy sauce and salt they were wonderful as always.

I tried to develop an EQ to fill in the wholes and pull down the highs but after 15 minutes, I gave up.  It continues to sound bright making some of my reference clips unlistenable.  I *think* this may be due to lack of deep bass which is screwing up the balance.Dynamic capability was superb.  Despite being a small speaker, it could play very loud with no hint of bottoming out. ConclusionObjectively the Emit M10 deviates from targets we have.  The deviation is not huge though but what is there had me stomped in listening tests.

Back bindings are custom tool metal ones and the best I have seen and felt. No question KEF has targeted high level of execution with this speaker.A coaxial driver handles midrange and tweeter responsibility.  Woofers then bring the bass along (3-way total).Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was the center of the tweeter (aligned by eye).  Measurement room was at 10 degrees C which may lower bass output a bit. I used a higher resolution scan than normal which turned out to not be necessary as the speaker is very well behaved in higher frequencies.  Accuracy is better than 1% as a result in most of the frequency spectrum.KEF 4C MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:While not ruler flan, on-axis response is very good.  Even better is directivity index (dashed blue at the bottom) showing that important early reflections are similar to on-axis response which you can see better here:Bass response is stepped down due to port tuning being low.  We can see this in the near-field response:Cabinet/port resonances are kept at bay so don't cause coloration in upper midrange as they usually do in ported speakers.Predicted in-room response is excellent:BTW, sensitivity is also excellent at 90 dB although you better have an amplifier that doesn't mind the very low impedance dip of just 2.9 ohm:The quad bass drivers and capable mid-range translate into incredibly low distortion and power capability:The biggest issue with the design of most center speakers is that the doubled up woofer/mid-woofer causes horizontal dispersion to narrow due to timing differential between them.  Is that solved here with the coaxial mid-range/mid-woofer?  Let's see:Speaker is so wide that there is still good bit of distance between the woofers causing some cancellation.  But generally, this is way better than most center speakers we have tested.The vertical response though shows how good this could be if all the drivers were aligned horizontally:For fan of timing analysis, here are the rest of the measurements of that type:Listening TestsI was in the process of wiring up the speaker to listen to it in the measurement lab when my worried wife ran into the room and said: ""downstairs bathroom is flooding!""  I rushed out to deal with that and have not had a chance to listen to the 4C yet.  I hope to still get a chance to do so and report back.ConclusionsThe fit and finish, design and capabilities of the 4C clearly show that this is a very serious engineering effort by KEF to produce a highly capable center speaker.  Physics of sound wavelengths still attack it a bit causing slight narrowing of directivity but otherwise, it is very hard to find fault with this speaker.I am going to recommend the KEF 4C based on objective data and subjective look and feel of the unit.  I expect it to be a super capable center speaker and a great one for 2-channel listening if you use it vertically.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly sent to me by a member for testing.  It costs US $239 from Amazon including shipping for a pair.I have to say, the Atom looks better than its price indicates:Look at the nice grill over the tweeter and curvy smooth waveguide.  Even the woofer seems like a step up from bargain basement with inverted dust cap and such.The back naturally looks plain:In case you are not familiar with Paradigm, they are a Canadian speaker company and a spin off of the research at NRC where Dr. Toole and Sean Olive worked.  So similar pedigree.  How well they follow that science is what we are going to examine here.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.The system performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of more or less 1%.Temperature was 60 degrees F.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was the center of the tweeter.  In another measurement online I noticed they used the boundary between tweeter and woofer.  Based on measurements to follow, I think center of the tweeter is the more correct one.Paradigm Monitor SE Atom MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Looks like Paradigm is half married to NRC research.  On-axis response is fairly uneven with a dip between 2 and 4 kHz followed by significant peaking and finally a bit resonance around 15 kHz or so.  On the other hand, they do have good directivity in the way the three graphs follow each other in parallel.  This will make equalization easier and room dependency lower.Because the directivity is good, off-axis fortunately and unfortunately looks like on-axis:So summing the two to get our predicted in-room frequency response has the same issues that we saw at the start:Shame.Here are the driver responses:The port integration with woofer seems good.  But the crossover is not as good as it could be, polluted likely by some port resonances.  And of course we have that rising response from the tweeter.Distortion data says what one expect in this category:As indicated, directivity is good so our horizontal dispersion is good as well:Here is our vertical directivity:Seems to me if I had put the center lower, it would have fallen more in that 3 to 4 kHz ditch.  So stay at or slightly above the tweeter axis.Finally, here is our impedance graph showing multitudes of resonances:Paradigm Monitor SE Atom Listening TestsAt first blush you get the impression of a highly detailed sound, nailing the ""showroom experience.""  Continue listening though and gradually the brightness starts to be much.  Everything sounds ""exciting"" for the lack of a better word.  You can almost hear the ""hiss"" in the recordings.  Or sensation thereof.  So out comes the EQ tools:Ignoring the 102 Hz one which is for a room mode in my listening space, the rest are basically eyeballing the on-axis errors.  I initially did not put in the filter at 3000 Hz but was necessary as the brilliance was gone with all the high frequency filters.Once there, I was pleasantly surprised by the fidelity of this little speaker.  It produced very clean sound at elevated volume courtesy of no deep bass.  This meant the woofer did not bottom out at all even on my ""speaker killer"" tracks.  This does mean you need a sub though as there is no physical sensation for bass.  Techno drums are fine but anything lower just doesn't get reproduced much.ConclusionsMy point of view of Paradigm is that they know the research.  But they have also survived in the brutal speaker retail market for decades.  As such, they have sacrificed some of what research says to compete on the showroom floor with likes of Klipsch.  So not a surprise that the highs are accentuated.  Luckily they did not throw out the science book and built good directivity into Atom.  And provide very good tuning for bass to keep things from getting distorted and out of hand.As is, without EQ, I cannot recommend the Paradigm Monitor SE Atom.  With EQ, it is quite serviceable and likely superior to other speakers.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Have to drive 700 miles tomorrow to pick up something cool.

He was kind enough to send me a sample. I let him explain the mods but basically the tweeter was replace with a higher quality one and a new modified crossover was put in place. Some padding was also added to the cabinet. He sold the modified pair for US $168 plus shipping. He no longer does this and has put his modifications in public domain.The Pioneer BS22 was obviously designed to fit a ridiculously low manufacturing cost point of view especially considering the nice touches such as the curved cabinets and such. I liked the sample I tested in near-field.  In this review I will be testing Dennis' speaker in far field.Visually the speaker doesn't look much different:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:The modification is hard to see on this graph until we overlay the original on-axis response of the Pioneer on it:We see that the response is much closer to the target flat on-axis response we look for good performing speakers.While I don't usually put a lot of emphasis on vertical dispersion, I was surprised to see good bit of improvement there:Early reflections are well behaved and smooth:This results in very nice predicted in-room response:Here is the before and after of the same:I think the bigger deal here is the reduction of distortion in the tweeter so let's compare the two:The crossover frequency (I think) is around 3 kHz.  Notice how the distortion is basically brought to nothing on the modified version on the left above that.  Whereas the original produces good bit of distortion especially around 5 kHz.Comparing 86 and 96 dB SPL @ 1 meter on Dennis' speaker we see this tweeter is clean almost regardless of power:It is the woofer that is going nuts as indicated before.  There is so much this cheap little 4 inch woofer can produce.Here are our directivity and waterfall measurements:In mid-frequencies the dispersion is as wide as +- 100 degrees.  Even at 20 kHz you have good bit of width to not having to lock your head a vice to listen.Even vertical dispersion allows some room to be above or below the tweeter:I did not try to optimize the waterfall.  It is looking too good to be right!Finally, here is the impedance graph:Speaker Listening TestsRegular readers of ASR know that per research, I listen to speaker in mono, placed to the left.  Mono listening let's one judge the tonality of the speaker and its distortions much easier (a lot less perceptual masking).  The performance of Affordable Accuracy Monitor in a word of superb!  I could not believe how well it played through track after track in my reference list.  Anyone who thinks mono listening can't sound good, should try listening to a well designed speaker.  Alternatively, I suggest turning off one of the channels in your system and see how much you like the sound!Sure, the bass driver craps out all of a sudden when you play loud with low frequency content.  I adjusted the volume so that it was high enough in my huge space while avoiding its limit.  I was then greeted with some of the best mid to high frequency presentation I had heard.  Female vocals were to die for.  Anything with a high frequency transients was produced with a clarity and beauty that was uncanny.  They stood out not be cause they were over emphasized but because they were so clean and for a lack of a better word, ""hi-fi.""I was surprised that even male vocals sounded wonderful.  Play some Muddy Waters and you would have a smile on your face.You could easily sense the dual personality of this speaker.  Play something with just low notes and the sound was ordinary.  Some piano tracks left me empty this way.  But anything with modicum of full spectrum would bring ear to ear smile to my face.I sat there for at least an hour going through my long playlist.  I did not want to stop but stop I had to as it was past midnight and I was keeping my wife awake.  Note that my playlist was generated from listening to my library on my Revel Salon 2 speakers (around $23,000 a pair).  This little speaker shows that if you follow the science with flat on-axis response and low distortion, you can emulate a lot of that experience with just $168.  If the while industry did this, then we would have many good speakers that do justice to our content regardless of who designed them.ConclusionsI am saddened that this little jewel is not produced anymore.  I fully understand as I can't imagine buying these speakers and spending another $86 in parts and selling them for just $168.  It would be definition of slavery in my opinion.    I wish you all could sit here and listen to this speaker providing excellent enjoyment to well recorded music with just some limitations on bass and low-frequency loudness.I am going to try to buy this sample from Dennis and hopefully one day use it for blind listening tests with our audiophile group.Naturally, I highly recommended the Affordable Accuracy Monitor (AAM) if you can get your hands on it.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The pink panthers wore through all their pink mask.

It is on kind loan from a member who sent a pair to me at great cost (they come two in a box).  The R3 costs US $1,999 for a pair.The R3 is an example of superb industrial design by KEF:It oozes elegance and comes in a number of colors to please anyone.  It is also highly differentiated by its coaxial design and gorgeous woofer.The back side looks plain but you are not going to be looking at that:The sharp corners make for a nice design but likely not good for diffraction effects (little speakers playing on their own at ever corner).We have the same knobs that allow the woofer to be separated from the rest to bi-wire/bi-amp the speaker.  I only tested the R3 as one unit.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 0.7 Hz (yes, less than 1 Hz) and plots are at 20 points/octave. Spatial 3-D resolution is 1 degree.Over 800 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field to almost 20 kHz where error increased a bit (likely not visible on graphs).Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:They eye averages this out to pretty flat on-axis response.  While not high in amplitude, there is a broad increase in level between 3 and 10 kHz.  This will hit a lot more musical notes so it may make the speaker a bit bright relative to a speaker that has some choppiness but narrow peaks.Sensitivity is on the money with respect to company spec if you look at mid frequencies.  Deep bass though is lower at around 80 dB so amplification requirements will be significant.We can use statistical model of listening spaces to determine, using 3-D measurements we have around the speaker, what you will hear in a real room (above is anechoic or ""free field"" data).  That gives us this likely response:Due to well behaved off-axis response, the curve more or less shows what the on-axis did which is good.  The sloping down is expected and required.  Because of good ""directivity"" (off-axis versus on-axis), EQ should be effective and a touch of that may improve subjective performance in upper range.  Otherwise the slight suck-out in 1000 to 2000 may be too audible in how it will send that range into the background a bit.Impedance dips to 3 ohms which is quite low, emphasizing the point I made earlier about needing a good amplifier to drive these speakers:40 Hz happens to be highest peak in the spectrum of a set of files in my music library so having the lowest impedance there is unfortunately.  Another dip exists at 150 Hz.The distortion graphs is still work in progress as I continue to fight the Klippel software to generate proper SPL measures.  It seems that in this graph, despite what I reported earlier, SPLs are not trustworthy.  The ratios are.  So let's look at that while giving the speaker 10 volts to push it more than 2.83 volts that I use for spinorama:As noted, this measurement takes out the room using clever filtering in Klippel software (uses the free-field response to compensate).  This results in much smoother low frequencies with no need to use gating, and response down to 20 Hz.  I truncated at 50 Hz however as allowing it to go below that, shoots the distortion to nearly 100% as the speaker is incapable of producing usable output that low.  An effect that I could hear in the sweeps.There is no sudden peaks or other anomalies that stand out.  Very low frequency dominates (as does with all speakers tested) which due to our high threshold of hearing and masking, likely is not very audible.I let you all study the waterfall and see if you can correlated the little wiggles in the spinorama with the graph here:And here is our directivity shots:We see that 0 degree doesn't land at the center of the the driver indicating that the acoustic axis is a bit lower.  Or I did not quite center the mic on the tweeter (a very delicate job given the lack of protection on the driver).   I went through the painful process of compensating for this (trial and error with every cycle taking 15 minutes) but it made no difference at all in the spinorama results.  Not sure if this is right or wrong.  Will have to ponder more on the data and/or ask Klippel.Here is the vertical slice:It is as pretty as single coaxial drivers due to woofer handling lower bass now.Speaker Listening TestsI setup the KEF R3 in the same far-field setting I have used for my other high-fi speakers in my main system.  It is stand mounted with tweeter roughly at ear level with me sitting some 12 feet away.  The speaker was driven by a 1,000 watt monoblock amplifier (into 4 ohm) so power availability not an issue.  Fancy audiophile cable was used so no worries there.First the good news: the type of buzzing distortion I thought I heard with KEF Q100 was not there.  It was replaced by very clear response together with strong deep bass when required.  Power handling was now excellent as I could turn up the speaker as much as I needed and despite only one speaker playing.  The sound was clean.Alas, once again subjective feeling was low.  My standard routine is to cycle through my reference clips that I have selected during all my normal listening to sound superb on my Revel Salon 2 Speakers.  Sadly hardly any of them sounded all that good here.  Yes, the highs were there.  The lows at times were there.  But overall experience was unexciting and unengaging for lack of a better word.To make sure my mind has not gone crazy, I replaced the R3 with Revel M16 which I recently reviewed.   Wow, all that gorgeous came right back!  There are two things I clearly detect:1. Warm, fantastic mid to upper bass.  I can't emphasize enough how much difference this makes and how it impacts my subjective reviews.2. There is a ""loosness"" to notes that is hard to describe but notes are separated and delightfully clean and pleasant.  I get this same sense when I EQ a speaker for a room.EDIT:  later testing showed that the room mode at about 105 Hz was impacting the tonality of the speaker.  Once I filtered that, the sound was very good.  I have since made this part of the protocol.Discussion and ConclusionsThe objective measurements will nail the Olive score no doubt.  And they present for the third time a conflict with my subjective listening impressions.  Of course my subjective evaluation is much less reliable.  I like us to allow some allowance for them to sink in though.  Olive's latest tests shows people like to hear more bass than originally though.  So could this be behind my preference for speakers like Revel M16?  Here is its predicted-in room response:I am really starting to think the 100 to 200 Hz region plays a much stronger role than we think in subjective sound a speaker produces.  The other factor is not letting the higher frequencies dominate the mid-range.  As I noted in the review, broad deviations in the measurements, despite their low level, may have a much larger subjective difference.At some point we will have to reconcile these differences, either setting me straight on my subjective evaluations being wrong, or us not knowing all that Harman knows about good speaker sound.  Let's remember that they won't release a new speaker unless it passes double blind listening tests against its competitor.  No other score allows them to skip this test.  Components are tweaked until they achieve this.  So one wonders if this is not released to public.For now, objective measurements are superb enough to give a thumbs up to KEF R3 and hence the choice of panther.Personal note:This pair of speaker cost US $211 to ship to me with insurance.  This presented huge hardship for the owner to fund but he was adamant in doing his bit to help with our research into speaker technology.  I will be paying for shipping back but like to also help him what he has paid to get them to me.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Sadly we do have serious flaws in the mid frequencies.  Not only is the direct sound messed up, so is directivity.  Both of these are indications of a speaker not doing well in controlled listening tests according to research.We can see some reasons for above when we measure each driver up close:As noted, seems to me if the tweeter high pass filter was a bit lower it would fill in the ditch better.  As it is, the level is low which causes the resonance peak in the port (black) to cause more grief than it would otherwise.Early reflections are bad as we already know:And here is the predicted in-room response in a hypothetical, average room according to research:Clearly we don't want to apply this EQ to everything we listen to.I think the speaker is marketed for both desktop and far field use.  So I thought I run this new measurement that shows the difference in frequency response of 1 meter versus 4 meter (anechoic):Red is near-field.  Thick blue is far field which is naturally at lower level due to increased distance.  But if I compensate for that, we get the thin blue line over the red one.  As you see, the problem is slightly less acute in mid-frequencies when the speaker is used in far field.Horizontal directivity as we know is quite uneven which means room impact will be quite variable:Vertically you want to place the tweeter at or above your ear (but not too far):Finally here is the impedance and phase:EDIT:Forgot to post the distortion graphs initially:As noted, please don't be alarmed by those sharp peaks.  They are caused by the frequency response dropping there making the distortion percentage spike.  It is the same distortion but relative to a smaller amplitude.Woofer is the problem as we typically find.Subjective Speaker Listening TestsThe first second impression was ""this is not too bad"" and then bang: high frequency brightness hits you.  I rolled it off with a filter but that surprisingly did not help.  Filling in the hole in mid frequencies helped with those tones but added more brightness.  Rolling off the extreme low frequencies helped by reducing distortion.  But ultimately I could not rescue the HFS with quick filters.  Hence the reason I am not showing it.ConclusionsI watched a few online videos that were seeded by the company and all were generally positive.  Such was not my experience.  Both objectively and subjectively the Fluance misses the mark.  It did not sound hugely awful so I did not give it the decapitated panther.  But it is close.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Fluance HFS.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Work on preserving garden harvest continued.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:As noted on the graph, the on-axis (black) and listening window (dashed green) are mostly flat which is what we like to see in a speaker.  This means it won't emphasize or de-emphasize some notes at the expense of others.  Now, where you draw the line is tricky because there is a hump at 100 Hz or so.  I usually opt to use 200 Hz as the reference point and there, we see extra low bass, some weakness in upper bass and some peaking at higher frequencies.There seems to be little attempt to splice the tweeter and woofer response so that their radiation width match.  As a result, the woofer keeps getting directional up to about 2 kHz but when the tweeter starts to take over, the width expands suddenly.  This usually screws up the off-axis sound of the speaker but in this case, they important reflections tend to balance out:So what showers your walls will be tonally close to the direct sound you hear from the speaker which is a good thing.Putting the two together we get the tonality that you may hear in your room:Generally smooth and correct but with some ups and downs that could use tweaking.  There is extra bass which mostly people will probably like but be mindful of it activating room modes more and cause booming sound (without EQ).Impedance doesn't dip too low which should make it more amplifier friendly:There is a slight kink in the response around 200 to 300 Hz which indicates some kind of resonance.  It may be what we also see in the ""waterfall"" graph:If these are due to the cabinet construction, then what you get in your build can be different.  GR research measurements for example don't show the resonance around 1 kHz. This could be due to lack of resolution or proper testing on their part, or different cabinet.  As always note that this measurement can be manipulated to show no problem or as much as you want!Speaker Radiation PatternIdeally a speaker radiates sound in a predictable manner relative to direct sound.  Due to directivity errors, we don't have that here:If you follow the red line that shows when the response is down -6 dB relative to on-axis, the graph goes up and down a lot.  So there is no uniformity which means how you toe in the speaker and the shape/reflectivity of your room can change the sound of this speaker fair bit.  Your subjective results then may not match mine or the measurements.In 3-D we see the same thing:Notice how the red region changes its width.Vertically most 2-way speakers are bad but that doesn't seem to be a major issue in subjective listening:You have more leeway with having the tweeter axis be below your ear height than above.  If you go too far, you land in the non-red region meaning there is a lot of deficiency in that frequency region so you want to avoid that.Speaker Distortion MeasurementsI am only going to show Klippel distortion measurements and not Audio Precision in the hopes of having a life beyond reviewing speakers.  At 86 dB SPL @ 1 meter, distortion is pretty much under control.  Turn up the levels 10 dB though and the bass distortion naturally goes through the roof and the tweeter gets unhappy as well.  But overall it is not too bad:As noted, and as I could hear during testing, the very low frequencies are severely distorted and don't sound anything like proper low notes so best to filter them out if you can.EDIT: Forgot to post the individual driver responses:Subjective Speaker Listening TestsOut of the box, the XLS Encore sounded good.  Yes there was a bit of exaggeration in bass which most of the time gave a warm impression to the sound (good).  But there were occasional sharpness that would interfere (especially on female vocals).  And there was a bit of muddiness/distortion.  So I dug out the EQ tools and used the measurements to make a few corrections:I first added Band 3 which gave the speaker a bit more air and clarity in upper bass.Getting rid of bass distortion was hard as my standard filters would take away good bass (some of the distortion helps with sensation of bass).  I eventually landed on the gradual filter as shown which nicely improved note separation and muddiness that was there before it.  You would have to experiment in your room since that heavily impacts what is there.Once there, I still could hear the occasional sharpness that would stand out depending on activation (i.e. content).  I put in a dip where the peak was in on-axis around 7.2 khz and that tamed but did not fully remove it.  More effort would be needed than me eyeballing it.  Once there, this was a very nice speaker and I started to listen to track after track with enjoyment.  One of my delightful tracks is from Mary Coughlan's After the Fall album:I can only find this horribly recorded live version of it:The X-LS Encore could play very loud even in mono configuration (how I test).  It also managed to play the Dunwell's Animal track with its deep bass.ConclusionsThe GR Research X-LS Encore DIY KIT build as I tested shows very good performance which with a bit of EQ, rose up to near excellent.  Yes there are some technical errors in directivity but otherwise, good attempt has been made to produce near neutral presentation which is what we strive for.I am happy to recommend the GR Research DIY Kit (sans all the voodoo tweaks he offers).Much thanks to Rick for building this speaker and sending it to me.

It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  The DBR-62 costs US $600 a pair from multiple sources/dealers.The DBR-62 comes in black and walnut finish or the distressed Oak and white which is what I received:I really like the baffle, the slot port and woofer.  The grill on the tweeter is a bit out of place in my mind but not overly so.  Overall, it is a very modern take on speaker design which I like.  It comes with a gray patterned grill which can hide the drivers if you like.So far my reviews of other Andrew Jones speakers has not resulted in any star performers.  Some have actually been disappointing.  Will the DBR-62 be an exception?  Let's find out.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 2.7 Hz. Over 700 measurement points were used to assure high precision in higher frequencies, resulting in well under 1% error. I am also using averaging to lower noise in bass frequencies. I also doubled the drive voltage (for spinorama) to overcome low frequency noise in my setting.All measurements are with no grill and on tweeter axis.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:On-axis response is quite flat for a budget bookshelf speaker.  Yes, there are a few peaks here and there including a resonance around 610 Hz which you can also see in the waterfall display:Predicted in-room response is quite good as well, indicating off-axis performance that is close to on-axis:I note EQ but in later listening, I don't think that is necessary.Here is the response for the most powerful and audible reflections in a typical room:Minimum impedance is 5 ohm which is above most bookshelf speakers which drop below 4 ohm:However, note the area I have circled.  Impedance is high at about 8 ohms but the phase angle is quite acute at nearly 50 degrees.  This means the speaker will ask for current when the output voltage is very low.  So you better have a beefy amplifier to drive this speaker.Edit:  Distortion measurementEye-candy Speaker MeasurementsHorizontal directivity shows that most of the response enjoys a very wide, nearly 80 degree angle:This means toe-in angle is quite forgiving.  And there is wide sweet (listening) spot.Vertical angle is much worse and is typical of two-way speakers of this design:Which backs my recommendation to absorb those reflections if it doesn't make your room too dead.I zoomed in the 3-D soundfield at the resonance frequency for fun:On the right is our woofer/port.  On the left is the back of the speaker.  So it looks like the back is resonating and causing interference pattern with the front wave.Speaker Listening TestsAh, what joy!  Just put the ELAC DBR-62 on the stand and with no fiddling/adjusting, etc. it sounded superb!  Absolutely superb.  Balanced sound with tons of detail.  Bass output was impressive.  Despite use of a single speaker in my testing, it could fill my massive space with plenty of powerful low energy.  Mind you, there was 1000 watts on tap to drive it but still, the speaker showed little sign of stress.  At extremely high levels (ear bleeding) I could hear some resonances but back off a bit and you were invited to incredible performance.I went through some 20 to 30 reference tracks and every one, without exception sounded amazing!  With some speakers I have to hunt to find a good sounding track or two.  Not with the Elac DBR-62.Note that the only EQ I used was for the 200 bass mode in my room.  There is enough bass out of this speaker to energize that mode so be sure to have some means of EQ for your bass frequencies. Above that, none is needed but you are welcome to try some to taste (broad, low-Q EQ).ConclusionsThe ELAC DBR-62 objectively and subjectively meets and exceeds my expectations.  It is ""Andrew Jones"" as I expected but had been missing up to now.  It is ""high-end"" sound on a budget with little to apologize for.  I was sad to stop listening to it to type this review!  It is that good.Message to Andrew: please stop messing with coaxial drivers and such.  Optimized 2-way system like this outperforms them all.  They design won't sound sexy on paper but boy does it sound good in person.  And no fussiness with placement in room either.So save up if you have to but don't settle for anything less than this.  I am happy to give my strongest recommendation for ELAC DBR-62.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Two things make me happy: audio products that are well engineered and money.

It is on kind loan from a member.  It is an older design dating back to 2002 from the bit of research I have done.  I can't find the pricing.The fit and finish is very good:The grill is screwed in.  I took that as a signal to use the speaker that way so I tested it with it.  Just the same, the speaker is titled back good but and that is how I measured and listened to it.The back panel is simple but further shows the elegance in the design:I believe the claim to fame on the design of this speaker is that the woofer is directly driven with no crossover.  Reminds me of the same approach by Totem Acoustics. If so, this should present an interesting set of measurements.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was enough to compute the sound field of the speaker within 1% error.Temperature was 76 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.For reference point, I used the tweeter axis.  And per above, I let the speaker be raked back as designed.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:And flaws is what we have.  Clearly this is a strong equalization applied to everything you play.  Bass is attenuated and then we have peaking and dips everywhere.Around the crossover point of 4.8 kHz directivity gets shot with on-axis response dipping even below reflected sounds although the listening window is better.Strangely, the of-axis early reflections look more even:That tames our predicted in-room response:We want tilting down response which we don't have here so likely the sound will be bright especially given the lack of bass.To investigate what is going on, I measured the individual drivers at close distance and this is the composite:The woofer is breaking up/resonating around crossover frequencies.  We also have peaking from the port around 800 Hz.  The tweeter also is not linear showing a few peaks.Horizontal beamwidth is chewed up:Same is true of full directivity map:Vertical directivity is interesting:It seems that you are better off being above my measured axis (center of the tweeter).  In which case, why tilt up the speaker by design?  As you see the black reference line goes to through lower energy region around 2 to 6 kHz the way it is.Distortion is reasonable at 86 dBSPL but gets bad at 96:Finally here is impedance and phase:Speaker Subjective Listening TestsThe sound out of the box was disappointing.  It was somewhat bright, with no bass and dull.  The Genesis track I played as the first one was not listenable.  Performance improved a bit with other content but was still problematic as described.  So instead of continuing, I quickly threw in an EQ:This made a dramatic difference.  Bass was there now due to my inverse correction in the entire region sans the peaking around 1 kHz.  Detail was much improved.  It was still a bit too bright but a bit more effort would make a difference there.  This clearly demonstrate that whatever idea there was behind that frequency response was not correct.ConclusionsObjective measurements clearly show a flawed design which was then backed in subjective listening.  The science here is quite intuitive and strong: we don't want the speaker to drastically vary the frequency response of the music we listen to.   The lack of bass may have been perceived as having ""lower distortion"" but such was not the case.  Distortion was there without sufficient bass energy which is highly desirable by listeners.Fortunately Equalization was very effective to turn this speaker from terrible to usable. Needless to say, I can't recommend the Diapason Emera speaker.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.You all may remember be attempting to make raisins out of our overflow of red grapes.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:There are some variations in the on-axis frequency response but some go away in the listening window (average of a few degrees around the direct axis).  The large disparity in size between tweeter and woofer also creates some directivity error where the woofer starts to ""beam"" (its radiation narrows) yet the tweeter starts with a wider beam width causing a dip in off-axis response.There are no signs of serious resonances though which is good.Early window reflections are pretty smooth making this speaker easy to place in a room and have it sound good:Putting on-axis and reflections together we get a predicted in-room frequency response in a hypothetical average room:This is really good folks!  Some of the variations in on-axis are filed away resulting in almost ideal frequency response.  Since what you hear in your room is the sum of direct and indirect sounds, this type of response bodes well for actual performance in one's room.I read some place that Kevin Voecks (most visible person behind Revel line) said that there was strong effort to reduce distortion and that they had managed to push it below audibility in mid to higher frequencies.  So let's measure that:Wow, seems true!  At 86 dB the graphs essentially hugs the bottom of the graph.  Even when pushed to 96 dB, there is hardly any rise in distortion.  This is the type of performance we expect to see in high-end active studio monitors, not home bookshelf speakers.Putting the distortion in context at 96 dB we get:Usually I set the lower limit at -50 dB as shown.  But received a good request to show it down to lower levels so here we are.    We can see that distortion products linearly go down and hit some of their lowest where our hearing is most sensitive (2 to 5 kHz).  Second harmonic dominates across the board.  Third harmonic does peak up near 3 kHz but otherwise is not dominant.Looking at how wide of a ""beam"" the speaker projects we get about 100 degrees:The drop off is smooth:Vertical is not bad for this type of speaker and gives you some wiggle room with respect to the height of your stance and your ear level:You don't want to go so high or low below tweeter axis as to land in these ""eyes"" around 2 kHz.Directivity is reasonably smooth as well again, given the type and design.Impedance shows the typical minimum impedance:So don't let the small size make you think you need a small little amplifier to drive it.You all know I am not a big fan of waterfall graphs but this one sure looks clean and uneventful:Subjective Speaker Listening TestsFor testing, I go through my reference track list, often playing 20 to 30 seconds before going to next one.  This way, I can quickly get a sense of speaker's overall performance across wide range of content with different spectrum.  Well, that didn't happen here.  As soon as I played the first track, I froze in place.  The sound was so incredibly smooth and beautiful that I could not hit ""next"" on my player!  Incredible amount of detail.  Resolution to die for.  The note decay was tremendous.  This was that first track, Youn Sun Nah - My Favorite Things:The Youtube version sounds poor.  I have the 88 kHz high-res download.  Get a copy of this track and if it doesn't make you melt in your seat with audiophile bliss, you have the wrong speaker/system!I go to the next track, Snowflake from Kristin AsbjørnsenThe starting strings seem to jet out of the speaker with startling realism.  And then the beautiful vocals came through, with nice layering and separation.Sit .... back... down.  This is not some subjectivist speaker review.  To wit, my wife was in the bedroom getting ready to go to sleep but she did not come out to tell me how great the speaker was!Back to my testing, after listening to a dozen reference track and being most impressed with them all, I switched to bass heavy ones.  There is no deep bass here but what is there is incredibly clean.  And this speaker can play them loud.  Really loud with no sign of strain.  I had no trouble filling my huge space with just a single speaker playing.  Tracks like the classic Samba by Jean Claude Kerinec & Staff Elmeddah could not be more dynamic coming out of this little speaker:Words really fail me to describe the clarity, fidelity and yes, neutrality of this speaker.ConclusionsThe Revel M106 is not cheap in a sea of bookshelf speakers selling for 1/5 its price or even lower.  But I am here to tell you that it achieves a level of fidelity many of us strive for.  Its objective frequency response is very good.  But I think part of the superb fluidity and clarity it brings to delicate notes is its extremely low distortion.  I wish you could be here to listen to it and experience what I did.  To say that I am impressed by it is an understatement.The Revel M106 is one of the most perfect bookshelf speakers I have heard.  As such, I am going to give it my strongest recommendation.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Here is my routine every night: eat dinner, go to the garden and dig, de-weed, put compost on plants, fertilize and water them.

It was a venture from their UK division from what I have read (in early 1990s).  Phil Ward tells the story well in this article: https://musicandmiscellany.com/2019/06/08/canon-audio-part-1/ .  The S-50 was purchased by a member and kindly sent to me from UK. As with most omni speakers, the S-50 has a very unusual shape:Yes, you can call it Packman speaker.  Or Darth Vader helmet.  I tend to think the latter.They made a poor choice of putting the speaker terminals underneath which made termination and measurements a bit of a pain:I have seen a stand in some of the picture so that may have helped with this problem.If you want to peak inside, this is what it looks like with a down-firing little driver:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used a relative high number of scan points (> 800) but it still was not enough to characterize the response above 10 kHz.   So there is some error there.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We quickly see that the speaker lives up to its definition if you look at frequencies up to 3 kHz or so.  Sound power (red) is nearly identical to on-axis response! After 3 kHz, bad things start to happen and with it, screws up the directivity as well.Early reflections shows what we already know:Ditto for predicted in-room response:Examining the horizontal directivity in detail we get a better view:Even up to 3 kHz we get +- 180 degrees of dispersion indicating omni-directional dispersion. Of course the details are quite flawed.  We have a hole around 500 Hz and then wheels fall off the wagon above 3 kHz.  Directivity narrows and response is very uneven.Vertical directivity is also wide but much, much messier still:So I don't think vertically you get even response if you move up and down from speaker axis.While on pretty colorful pictures, I thought I plot the 3-D representation of the soundfield at 17 kHz:Stunning to look at!  But not to listen to as it indicates so many resonances and problems distributed in space.  No wonder Klippel NFS can't characterize it unless we measure at thousands of points.Impedance shoots way up high in low frequencies indicating a high pass filter of sorts:Distortion is off the charts in low frequencies but also problematic at higher:And this is just at 86 dB SPL, not the 96 I usually run.  So don't expect to play it loud. Speaker Subjective Listening TestsI connected the S-50 to my system in the usual left corner position ( a few feet from walls).  I was immediately greeted with significant distortion with every bass note.  Turning down the volume helped a bit but the problem was still there.I went to it and realized it was the ""helmet"" that was vibrating like crazy with every beat.  I pushed down on it and it almost eliminated the problem. I thought of sitting on it for the rest of the listening tests but got worried as to what might hatch under me.So instead, I dialed in a high pass filter in Roon player:This was enough to give me the ability to turn up the volume reasonably to listen.  Needs even more filtering for any real use.Anyway, I went to town, avoiding my bass heavy tracks.  Since you all keep asking me for my tracks, here is one of my favorites (both for content and fidelity despite its age):Ah, boy did this track sound good!  The wide dispersion gave it more openness, provide more of a ""live"" feel to this track.  Anyone who thinks ""reflections are bad"" needs to get this speaker and play this track!  No, it didn't add any echos.  It just ever so slightly adds ambiance. The high distortion did not let me enjoy many other tracks but as far as I could tell, it would add the same but more subtle version of the above to instrumentation tracks I played.  Overall tonality was actually good.I then went down to the speaker level and shifted 90 degrees to the side of the speaker.  It was uncanny how the tonality overall did not change.  This would be a great feature for background listening even in mono.Vertical response in high frequencies was noticeable though with best response pointing right at the speaker. ConclusionsTesting the Canon S-50 was a wonderful exercise in measurements and listening to something different.  It is a good concept for some music but with highly flawed execution.  Perhaps the higher ups in the line would not have had the problems this little guy has.  If you can pick one on the cheap (I read some people buying them for $150 and such), it is very worthwhile from educational point of view, if not listening.And who doesn't like a cute little speaker like this?-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Installed the Burger King app on my phone to take advantage of the discounts they offer.

We have three broad areas of error, two of which are boost and one is a dip.  Directivity is good for some of this range but gets messed up during the crossover frequency.  Speaking of which, here is the near-field response of each driver:Unless I am aligning the two curves wrong, it seems that the tweeter is crossed at too high a frequency (or vice versa) causing a droop in the intersection which is what we saw in the spin graph (between 1 and 2 kHz).  There is also resonance or lack of baffle compensation for the midrange driver which could be responsible for peaking we saw centered around 880 Hz.Early reflections are a mess as well as one would predict:And as a result, the predicted in-room response:We can see the crossover directivity error clearly in our horizontal beamwidth and directivity measurements:Vertical response gets much worse if you go below the tweeter axis so try to point it toward your ear:Power handling is quite good for such a shallow and small speaker, albeit aided by lack of bass:As usual, our impedance and phase measurement shows low frequency resonances:Impedance of 3.2 ohm is quite low but you probably won't be pushing this speaker too loud so may be OK.And for fans of timing analysis, here are the three of them:KEF T101 Listening Tests and EqualizationSeeing how one of the main applications are wall mounting I put the T101 in front of my flat screen TV to simulate a back wall.  What I heard was the least hi-fi sound I could describe!  I had to immediately shut the system down and move it to the stand away from walls which provided some relief.  Still, overall signature was still wrong and very bright.  Some of this is due to lack of bass but still, I could not tolerate it for much before applying EQ:The first two filters are self explanatory.  I put in the shelf quickly to get rid of the brightness.  A more precise filter may have done better as the sound was still on the bright side.  But compared to before, at least it was not flat broken sounding.I was impressed with the ability of the T101 to play loud.  Yes, there is zero deep bass but still, this is a little flat panel speaker so this much power handling was impressive.I tried to add some bass to it with a filter at 100 and then 150 Hz but it just got tubby and poor sounding so I abandoned that.ConclusionsI admire the three years of engineering KEF says they put in this product.  I am amazed though at the end they decided to create such an objectively flawed response for a company with their skills and tools.  What were they thinking?  Crossover with a hole in it?  Terrible boosted lower terrible?  To what end?  Yes, there is a bit of ""showroom sound"" effect there but come on, let's follow good practices in speaker design.  Given the very positive effects of EQ, I can see that the components are wasted away in this implementation. Needless to say, I can't recommend KEF T101, period.  It is one, if not the worse sounding speaker I have tested.  Yes, I appreciate the size constraints but per above, I think they could have done much better.  EQ solves major ills with the unit but not to the level that makes it OK to my ears.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,500 for a pair back in mid 1990s.I don't know how many of you were in home theater back then but the M&K speakers were cat's meow due to their use in film sound mastering. Folks would point to the pictures of them soffit mounted there and stand back and say, ""this is why I bought it!"" It was a sign of having arrived in home theater. I didn't own these bookshelves but did have their massive subs for my theater.  I always envisioned these to be a large speaker but they are quite tiny at just a foot high. The face slanted so if the back is against the wall, it toes in automatically toward the center.Back panel harkens back to days where companies put their address on the back of their products!And those were also the day when having  THX logo carried the water for you, hence the designation here.  Despite strong fan support company went bankrupt and then came back a while later.  I looked at they have replaced foams around the tweeters with waveguides.  But otherwise they look similar.Was the reputation well deserved?  Let's measure and listen to see if that is so.M&K S-150THX MeasurementsLet's start with our Klippel NFS anechoic measurements:Color me surprised with that flat on axis response!  Five drivers working together and they still produced a flat response.  Quite remarkable.  Alas, physics is hard to avoid and the drivers interfere with each other causing beam forming/narrowing of the response.  We see that in the off-axis response having less energy above 800 Hz.  We can see that clearly in the vertical axis:In an interview the designer said this was actually a THX requirement that you have to sit precisely on axis with zero deviation from that!  That's cool but this uneven off-axis bounces around the room still and creates an uneven response:I tried to draw a straight line but that is not really possible.  Still not too bad.  We can drill more into the directivity:Since the speaker has non-symmetrical, you get rough response going to the right of the speaker:The issue as mentioned is much more severe in vertical axis:Multiple drivers mess up the directivity but do wonders for power ability:Again, keep in mind that this is a small bookshelf size/studio monitor speaker.Impedance is rated at 4 ohm but as usual, that is a bit of wishful thinking:There is a distinct resonance around 5 kHz in the waterfall plot but I don't see it elsewhere which is kind of odd:Finally, here is the step response:M&K S-150THX Listening Tests and EqualizationThis is the kind of speaker that stomps a subjective reviewer.  It at the same time sounds right and wrong. While I could not find much fault with it, I also didn't enjoy anything I played on it either! One thing I did notice was that the sound was coming from the small footprint of the speaker likely due to narrow vertical dispersion.  There was nothing to EQ as far as on-axis so I resorted to using the predicted in-room response as a guide to boost the lower treble:That made the sound more open but also somewhat bright.  So I put in a bass boost as if this was a ported speaker.  The combination made a dramatic difference. The sound was now much more open and ""high-fi"" for the lack of a better term.  We had good bass and the sound became more diffused, enlarging the halo of the speaker.  I detected no sign of stress in the speaker despite that bass boost.  Power handling remained very good.ConclusionsNice to go and really evaluate products that had a strong buzz around them in a different era.  The S-150 shows some of the characteristics that made it famous as far as low distortion and flat on-axis response. But physics of sound caught up to it causing uneven off-axis response.  The tonality we hear is the combination of those two which was not to my liking.  Some EQ fixed that though.  And I should note that in real application this speaker would be crossed to a sub and have some sort of EQ applied to it.  Overall not bad!----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

And that involves super lightweight design and shoddy construction that allowed the front baffle completely separate itself from the enclosure in shipping!They have a rabbet all around which provides for large surface area for the glue and air tight construction.  Why did they resort to these wedges that gave out due to weak fibers in the MDF?  A couple of screws would have helped keep it there as well.At least there is some foam inside:They put money toward bi-wiring terminals that no one uses but likely checks a box for marketing:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Lots of issues here starting with tweeter frequency not being flat and elevated.  The woofers are getting more directional before tweeter takes over and presents a wider dispersion.  Near-field measurement shows the many flaws:We clearly see the issues with the tweeter but also the port letting out a resonance right at the crossover.  The woofers are allowed to play up to 5 kHz making me wonder if the filter for it has too little slope.Early window response has no choice but to be messy:Summing these produces an estimated response in your room that is likely to be quite bright:Bass response is low which helps keep distortion in check especially given the dual woofers:Horizontal beam width is not pretty as we could already guess from the spin graph:I think this is the first MTM configuration speaker we have tested so its classic dispersion is nice to see:Edit: forgot the impedance and phase:Polk Monitor 40 Series II Listening TestsOh wow, this speaker is bright!  High frequency notes literally jump out of the speaker and meet you half way!  I must say, I can see the appeal of that in a showroom and with casual listeners.  Bad choice to throw at me though as I am super sensitive to high frequency accentuation (spent so much time training to hear distortion in them).  So I had to pull out the parametric EQ tool in Roon right away:This is a quick and dirty correction to make the sound bearable.  It was still bright but likely if you add a sub, it would balance it out.Power handling was excellent because there is essentially no sub-bass reproduction so my killer tracks of this kind did not do much to Monitor 40.ConclusionsThe Polk Monitor 40 Series II is a great example of what you have to do to bring the cost down to crazy low yet keep the showroom appeal high.  is this the most broken thing Polk could design?  No, that would require a lot of distortion as well which I did not find.  Still, without equalization and lots of playing around with that I don't see this being a useful speaker to live with, monetary savings be damned.  Eat less outdoors, save the money, and buy something better please!I can not recommend the Polk Monitor 40 Series II.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Had a miserable day yesterday.

It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $315 from Amazon including free shipping.It is so hard for companies to differentiate themselves with budget speakers but Q Acoustics has done it:It is modern but not too European looking for American taste.  It also manages to look cute in the process!  There is definitely attention to visual design all around.The binding posts are custom and recessed which is nice.  The plastic handles though are a bit hard to tighten but not a big deal.  Overall it is very hard to not like the look and feel of the 3020i.Yes, this is continuing our theme of testing UK designed speakers although this one naturally is made in China.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:If you step far enough back, the on-axis response which is most important seems mostly flat.  Closer attention though shows fair bit of variations with a rise in the upper frequencies to the right.  We also have an unfortunate dip 2 to 4 kHz range of the crossover (2.4 kHz).  It also suffers from two dips which seem to be resonances (enclosure or the woofer).The woofer and tweeter beam widths are mismatched at crossover point resulting in different response off-axis than on-axis:Try to avoid/absorb floor and ceiling reflections if you can (my room has a thick rug).Putting it all together we get the predicted in-room response:Distortion is well controlled in the tweeter but not so in the woofer:Best not let this speaker play too low (see listening sections) as it is merely a distortion generator.Impedance is low as is typical of these bookshelf speakers so best have a good amplifier to drive it:We see the same problem area at 366 Hz that we saw in the ""spinorama"" frequency response measurement.  The waterfall shows the rest of the resonances:Here are the contributions from each component of the speaker in near-field measurement:I wonder if the crossover point should have been a bit lower.  It would have filled that dip more and avoided some of the distortion from the woofer.Beamwidth horizontally is on the narrow side:But it is also rather uneven so hard to make general statements about it.  In listening tests I preferred the speaker fully toed-in toward my ears (post EQ).Here are our full directivity plots:Good to see rather even vertical response so you don't to have the tweeter precisely at ear level.Speaker Subjective Listening TestsI listened to the 3020i while the data was being computed so didn't have the benefit of knowing its response in advance.  My first ""5 second"" impression was: ""oh, this sounds good.... but wait, it is bright.""  Not bright in distorted grungy way but just some high frequency energy that almost set off my tinnitus.  Further listening to female vocals demonstrated this clearly.  I could play really loud with no sign of the woofer bottoming out which is great for a budget speaker.Continuing to listen provided a mixed message of what the tonality of the speaker was.  At this point the measurements finished and I realized the reason was the uneven response which makes the experience content dependent.  So I went to work to correct it and this is what I ended with:As usual, please ignore filter band 1 as that is for a room mode and is specific to my situation.  You would need to find such a peak in your room using measurements and correct.Band 2 was a simple fix to high frequency shelving.  It nicely got rid of the zing way up which also helped with female vocals. I should say however that I can see how in quick listening such extra brightness may convince one that there is more detail there.   You may want to tune this more to taste (and your high frequency hearing ability).I took a shot at filling the dips in low frequencies (two resonances) but this was not effective.  High Q filters were not audible.  Low Q ones took away the bass.  So I gave up on correcting those, trusting the research conclusion that such narrow dips are likely not audible.Disturbed by the high distortion in low frequencies, I tried a technique with the last speaker I tested: put in a sharp filter below 40 Hz.  To my pleasant surprise, this had big effect on fidelity, increasing detail in frequencies well above its effective range.  Clarity improved good deal.  I am going to keep experimenting with this but seems like it is best to not let these small speakers to try to reproduce very low frequencies.Once there, the response was quite pleasant.  I toggled back and forth turning off all the filters and the EQ definitely helped.  But even without the EQ, I thought the response was fine.ConclusionsI struggled with how to rate the 3020i.  I vacillated between giving it the lower postman panther or the ""not bad"" one that it finally got.  You could have pushed me either way.  I find the non-EQ response to barely be offensive (mostly the high frequency exaggeration).  So if you are going to build a less than perfect speaker, you might as well do it this way.Overall, without EQ I can't recommend the Q Acoustics 3020i even though I love the design and some aspects of its sound (e.g. power handling).------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Typing this on hungry stomach yet again (2:45 pm and no lunch).

Yes, there is a resonance at 700 Hz or so but you can dial that down with EQ.The higher energy in treble region spells a bright sound which we see in our simulated room:Directivity is good though so we should be able to apply a better target curve and tame that.Blended early reflections (bold green) shows good response so no need to turn your room into a padded cell with absorbers:Distortion graph shows some nastiness around (likely) crossover point:Combination of that and tiled up response will probably give some ""zing"" to music.Impedance graph is typical of these 2-way speakers with dip into 4 ohm category:Both horizontal and vertical directivity is wide meaning you don't have to get your protractor out to set speaker angle:CSD/waterfall graph shows the resonance we saw at 700 Hz:As noted, this is at a both below tweeter.  When measuring at tweeter axis, there was a pronounced dip around 1.7  to 2 kHz.  This did not show up however in the spinorama.  Not sure what explains it.Grill or no Grill -- that is the questionMembers have been asking about effect of grill on frequency response.  Not a in mood to run the full spinorama so here is the in-room measurement difference:The effect is simple: as wavelength get smaller (i.e. frequencies go higher), the grill is no longer transparent and reflects the sound back at the tweeter causing summation and subtraction (depending on phase).   That causes the variation in frequency response.There is some attenuation of high frequencies so maybe the overall effect is positive for this speaker.For those of you who say to do this test all the time, it was a pain to re-align the speaker while installing the grill.  The speaker shifts easily under the pressure, rotating and moving out of position.Speaker Listening TestsFirst impressions were very positive.  Good bass performance and nice detail.  Alas, it doesn't take long until that extra treble energy gets to you.  I played with a few EQ settings and the one that worked best was aimed at reducing the distortion shown earlier:I can't help but think how good this speaker would be with a simple in-line resistor with the tweeter to kill off some of that excess energy.For comparison, I put in the Revel M20 in the same spot and it was a relief to hear a less elevated highs.  However, the M20 could not remotely play as loud as the R162!  Its woofer would break up at much lower levels than the Infinity.  Indeed, no matter how much power I pumped into the R162, it handled it without bottoming out!Overall, the woofer and bass performance is the start of the show.ConclusionsThe Infinity R162 definitely seems to have benefited from good design. Whether on purpose (to sell better in showroom) or not, the elevated highs are a bit of an issue but fortunately that cam be tamed with equalization.  The rest of the performance both objectively and subjective is very good and not at all that of a cheap junk speaker.So overall, if you like slight zing to your music or can EQ to remove that, then I am happy to recommend the Infinity R162.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We don't have a dead flat response but with variation being mostly peaks, a bit of EQ in those areas should tame them.One oddity is that the company measurements show a rising response climbing to 20 kHz.  Don't know what explains the discrepancy.  Regardless, I rather have it my way than theirs when it comes to sound.  Directivity index is not perfect either but is close enough that should allow for some judicious EQ per my note above:Finally, this is a prediction of what sound you may get in a typical room:It is as to be expected based on measurements we saw before it.Basic Speaker MeasurementsThe company specifies minimum impedance of 6 ohms but my sample dipped well below that:Given the bass efficiency of 85 dB and lower, you better have lots of power for amplification.Distortion measurements showed a concerning peak:The ribbon tweeter likely hitting some kind of mode and running away on its own.  We have a peak in frequency response after it that may be caused by this.Advanced Speaker MeasurementsIn the following two graphs, look for least amount of ""beard"" below the main axis response:Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsContour graph shows that good response remains for a wide window of +- 80 degrees:That means you can have a wide sweet spot, or ability to point the speaker forward and listen to them off-axis.Vertically is the opposite though:Best to put them at ear height (relative to center of the tweeter as I measured).Casual Listening TestsI don't have a controlled setting for hi-fi speaker testing yet.  I just place a single speaker close to my Revel Salon 2 and use its amplifier to listen to single channel.  There, the Sierra 2 produced better than expected sound.  Its nice and solid enclosure allowed me to turn it up quite high and most of my reference tracks sounded ""good.""  I could move around the speaker left and right with almost no tonality difference (i did this prior to confirming with contour plots above).  Vertically though, the angle is quite limited so per earlier note, use stands that allow you to have them at your ear height.ConclusionsThe Ascend Sierra 2 is not perfect but overall, it seems to be a good package. You are getting much better build quality and SPL capability in a small package.  And frequency response variations should be correctable to some extent with EQ.I personally want more perfection in the speaker so would not be buying it myself but you have the data to decide for yourself.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I have been so busy with equipment testing that I have not started my vegetable seedlings.

The cause of that seems to be the port response dropping (green):We also have ""directivity error"" with the woofer becoming directional but the tweeter not at crossover region which adds to the dip we have in upper bass:Putting the two together doesn't create a good picture:Impedance is higg in low to mid frequency for a bookshelf speaker:Normally this would be a good thing but with the low efficiency and the fact that amps produce much less power at higher impedances, you better have a lots of amplification power on tap to drive this small speaker.Beamwidth is wider in some frequencies but that is due to lack of uniformity:Which we also see in our 3-D graph:Vertically it is not good but this is typical of 2-way speakers:And here is our waterfall:Distortion MeasurementsThe above measurements are what we call ""small signal"" measurements.  Frequency response remains so at very low output levels.  Speakers though are inherently non-linear devices and this aspect comes out the louder you play them.  In that sense, these are ""large signal"" tests.  Thought I introduce this terminology now as we use it more in the future.Let's start with our usual distortion measurements at 86 dB and 96 dB SPL @ 1 meter using Klippel system:We are used to distortion in low frequencies.  Here they are certainly off the scale at 96 dB and to fair extent at 86 dB.  The woofer is small so not much output can be expected from it.  The rise in distortion in the tweeter is also there which is unfortunate.Here is how it looks as actual level:I could audibly here the large distortion in bass where instead of low frequency tone you hear ""Brrrrr.""  This is common though and is indicated usually by distortion that is actually higher than the signal itself as I have circled.  So there is really no fidelity there below 50 Hz.SPL limiting due to limitation of the woofer is gradual which is good:Looking at distortion at different levels vs frequency we see:And through the levels:I have been working on intermodulation distortion tests and finally have a good single metric value for any output level:We see a ""nice"" rise in distortion as levels go up as they should.Here is our 32-tone intermodulation distortion:And some straight harmonic distortion make up:Speaker Listening TestsAs luck would have it, I started listening with one of my headphone test tracks which is bass heavy.  The response here was the worst I have heard from any speaker.  Bass was muted, muffled and overall fidelity just wrong.  Fortunately as the playlist progressed and I listened to typical ""audiophile"" tracks with light string instruments and vocals, the performance was better.  But have any bass come into the picture and fidelity sinks and sinks low.So I attempted some fixes using EQ and landed on these two obvious ones:I had to boost the frequency of my low frequency cut to 40 Hz to a) reduce bass distortion and b) improve the fidelity elsewhere.  It may be non-intuitive but this filter actually improves warmth and sensation of bass!  How is that?  There is such a strong spray of harmonics from bass that the tail end accentuates higher frequencies.  Reduce that most extreme cases of that and you get to hear the music rather than distortion changing the spectrum.The quick fix for the dip in upper bass worked very well.  Directivity is good that region so EQ works well.With both of these fixes in there speaker became rather enjoyable.  It demands lots of power though and you have to be mindful of the little woofer getting too upset. ConclusionsWithout corrective EQ, I am sorry to say you are getting a lot more furniture than speaker.  Company shows near flat frequency response on its website but as you see, I don't get anything close to that.  They say the name ""WoW"" came about because how great this little speaker sounded.  I don't know what their reference is to get such an impression.  Without EQ I don't consider this speaker listenable unless you have a narrow taste in music where any amount of bass is excluded.Yes, I know the woofer is small so put in a high pass filter so it doesn't have to play and distort.  And fix the port tuning to not cause the dip in upper bass.Overall, a very disappointing performance and an unexpected one at that.  Needless to say, I can't recommend the Salk WoW1.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Nothing makes me more depressed than a review that shows a device to not perform well.

175,a354a92b-d073-4895-b7f1-a612a59ddba4,Standmount/Bookshelf Speaker,ELAC,Debut 2.0 B6.2,87.0,5.0,,6/22/20,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/elac-debut-2-0-b6-2-speaker-review.14272/,5.0," ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2 bookshelf speaker.  It was kindly purchased by a member new and sent to me for testing.  It costs US $245 from Amazon including free shipping.The Debut 2.0 has a decent look:It comes with an external grill that I did not use.  But I did leave the tweeter screen in place for testing.  It is likely a nod to retailers putting these in showrooms trying to keep fingers away from the delicate tweeter.The finish is fine except I saw a fine white line above the speaker:Back panel is as you expect:The binding posts as is typical are too close to each other and recessed in this case, making them pretty difficult to turn.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Overall, this is a rather flat response so response is not going to be too far from neutral.  A sharp resonance sticks out prominently at 700 Hz which you will see later in a number of other measurements. The woofer is getting directional before the tweeter takes over with its much wider beam width.Going back to the resonance, I made near field measurements (almost at driver/port location) to see what they each are doing:We see our 700 Hz resonance there as a peak in the woofer response so we know it is coming from that.  We can also detect the crossover frequency at near 2 kHz.There is a bump in tweeter response which seems intentional to give the speaker a bit more ""zing.""  The port (red) helps fill in the low-bass response.Back to our ""spinorama"" here is how the important reflections look in a room:We see a dip in energy around 2 kHz due to directivity error mentioned before.  Worst offenders are floor and ceiling reflections so at least a carpet is advised.  Putting everything together, we can plot a hypothetical frequency response in a simulated room:We see our dip in energy around 1 to 2 kHz again and then some increased amount after that. Distortion response at two different output levels is shown here:Response at 86 dB is very good.  At 96 dB we have the woofer getting unhappy around 400 Hz and tweeter screaming as well but that distortion is at pretty high frequencies.  In absolute levels we get this:As noted, in this plot I like to see nothing but blank space above 500 Hz.  We have some distortion here so not matching our ideals.Directivity plots are are as follows:I like the overall well behaved response although it is not super wide.  We see the same with fancy color graded chart:Vertical directivity is typical of 2-way speakers but while some speakers really fall apart off tweeter axis, here you have about +-20 degrees before response gets worse:Here is our waterfall telling us what we already know with respect to 700 Hz resonance:Finally, we have our impedance chart:Impedance at 5 ohm is above average (a good thing).  Once again we see a sign of our 700 Hz resonance in the form of a ""kink"" in the phase response (red).Speaker Listening Tests""5-second"" reaction to speaker first playing was neutral.  Nothing stood out as broken.  Nothing stood out as exceptional.  Usually it is one or the other.   Listening some more, the sound could be better as it was a bit bright and unexciting for lack of a better term. So I went after it with some Equalization.  I first corrected the 700 Hz peak.  It seemed to only reduce bass a bit and not much else.  I then pulled down the highs a bit, that seemed to make some things worse, some better.  So I then went after the mid-range dip and that was helpful:This increase in response brings out more air and detail in lower frequencies which I always find welcome.  With this in place, the pull down at 5 kHz (purple) was then more helpful than not.The teal one is for the room so ignore that.Once there, the speaker was pleasant.  And importantly, it can play loud, very loud!  It is most impressive speaker in that regard.  Even playing one speaker I could get it to nearly ear bleeding levels with almost no distortion!Performance when the needed volume was required was very good.  Above average to be sure.  But when not, it was ordinary.  Not in a bad way but not exciting.ConclusionsFrom what I read, the designer Andrew Jones tried to add some more highs to this second iteration of B6 speaker.  I find that change unwelcome as it made the speaker a bit bright.  I can see why that may sell speakers but I did not like this change.  The main issue with the speaker is the dip in response in important 1 to 2 kHz range.  Once corrected with EQ, and combined with its great ability to play loud due to its larger than typical woofer, this becomes a competent offering.I was torn how to rate this speaker.  I could say ""I like it"" or ""I don't know."" I could be pushed to go with either.  In interest of time and many important problems in life to ponder, I just gave it the latter panther rating and went about my business.  If you choose to buy the  ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2, I am not going to tell you it is a bad decision.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The weather is gorgeous outside.

575,60bd937f-f008-4e09-9a04-132e9c9692e5,Standmount/Bookshelf Speaker,Philharmonic,BMR,,,,7/18/20,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/philharmonic-bmr-speaker-review.14781/,,"Mostly copy/pasted from my review on my website.  I took some out so if you want to see the full review go here:https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/loudspeakers/philharmonic_bmr/Philharmonic BMR Bookshelf Speaker ReviewIntroDennis Murphy designed the Philharmonic BMR some years back and it lit up the DIY circuit. This is a 3-way “bookshelf” (a big bookshelf) incorporating the following drive units: RAAL, 64-10 Ribbon Tweeter, BMR 2.5″ Midrange, and Scan-Speak 18W8545-1 Paper-carbon cone woofer. There are countless threads about this speaker and the design available via a simple Google search so I won’t spend my time going on about it. It is important to note, though, this speaker tested is in a different cabinet than current offerings. This shouldn’t effect the results of the test considerably (I assume the same volume and port tuning is used with the various enclosure shapes) but it is worth noting as some response differences can arise with a rounded enclosure with a flat baffle vs other designs some may come up with for their own enclosure.The speaker can be purchased complete through Salk Sound for $2395 - 2595, depending on what finish you purchase. Alternatively, this speaker can be built as a kit via Meniscus Audio and you can also even purchase a “flat-pack” for the cabinet from Speaker Hardware. Fully assembled (but unfinished), the DIY route would cost you in the neighborhood of $1150 to 1450 (depending on the flat pack order) and if you decided to upgrade components from Meniscus you could do so as well.Foreword: Subjective Analysis vs Objective Data (click for more)Product Specs and PhotosGrille On:Objective DataUnless otherwise noted, all the data below was captured using Klippel Distortion Analyzer 2 and Klippel modules (TRF, DIS, LPM, ISC to name a few). Most of the data was exported to a text file and then graphed using my own MATLAB scripts in order to present the data in a specific way I prefer. However, some is given using Klippel’s graphing.Impedance Phase and Magnitude:Impedance measurements are provided both at 0.10 volts RMS and 2.83 volts RMS. The low-level voltage version is standard because it ensures the speaker/driver is in linear operating range. The higher voltage is to see what happens when the output voltage is increased to the 2.83vRMS speaker sensitivity test.From the above data we can see the following:The tuning frequency of the enclosure is approximately 32Hz.The minimum impedance dips to about 4.5 Ohms around 1.4kHz with a nominal impedance at 6 Ohms. You might be able to power this with a standard AVR (as long as it is 6 Ohm rated). However, the low sensitivity of this speaker and a long listening distance means it will need ample power to get to higher output levels so choose how you power this speaker accordingly.There are no signs of resonance (typically visible as bumps/wiggles in the impedance that deviate from the curve).Frequency Response:The measurement below provides the frequency response at the reference measurement axis - also known as the 0-degree axis or “on axis” plane - in this measurement condition was situated at the ribbon.The mean SPL, approximately 83.2dB at 2.83v/1m, is calculated over the frequency range of 300Hz to 3,000Hz.The blue shaded area represents the ±3dB response window from my calculated mean SPL value. As you can see in the blue window above, the Philharmonic BMR has a ±3dB response from 62Hz - 20kHz. Even better, a tighter window of linearity is provided in gray as ±1.5dB from the mean SPL and this speaker stays within this window from about 80Hz all the way to 20kHz (ignoring the 0.1dB around 4kHz). That is impressive!The speaker’s F3 point (the frequency at which the response has fallen 3dB relative to the mean SPL) is 62Hz and the F10 (the frequency at which the response has fallen by 10dB relative to the mean SPL) is 35Hz. This speaker has nice low frequency extension.The one thing I find a bit odd is the 1dB shelf below 300Hz. I can’t imagine this being baffle step because, from what I can tell, the crossover point between the woofer and the midrange is about 550Hz.Below are both the horizontal and vertical response over a limited window (90° horizontal, ±40° vertical). I have provided a “normalized” set of data as well. The normalization simply means that I took the difference of the on-axis response and compared the other axes’ measurements to the on-axis response which gives the viewer a good idea of the speaker performance, relative to the on-axis response, as you move off-axis.As I said above, the provided frequency response graphs were given with a limited set of data. I measured the response of the speaker’s vertical and horizontal axis in 10-degree steps over 360-degrees. Nearly 70 measurements in total are represented in my data. As you can imagine, providing all those data points in a single FR-type graphic below is a bit overwhelming and confusing for the viewer. A spectrogram is an alternate way to view this full set of data. This takes a 360-degree set of data and “collapses” it down to a rectangular representation of the various angles’ SPL. I have provided two sets of data: one set for horizontal and one for vertical. Each set consists of 2 graphics:Full response (20Hz - 20kHz with the angles from 0° to ±180°) with absolute SPL valuesFull, “normalized” response (20Hz - 20kHz with the angles from 0° to ±180°) with SPL values relative to the 0-degree axisNormalized plots make it easier to compare how the speaker’s off-axis response behaves relative to the on-axis response curve.The above spectrograms are the standard way of providing directivity graphics by most reviewers. Some prefer not to normalize the data. Some prefer to normalize the data. Either way, it’s a useful visual to get an idea of the directivity characteristics of a speaker or driver.However, these “collapsed” representations of the sound field are not very intuitively viewed. At least not to me. So, I came up with a different way to view the speaker’s horizontal and vertical sound field by providing it across a 360° range in a globe plot below. I have provided both an absolute SPL version as well as a normalized version of both the horizontal and vertical sound fields.Note the legend provided in the top left of each image which helps you understand speaker orientation provided in my global plots below.CEA-2034 (aka: Spinorama):The following set of data is populated via 360-degree, 10° stepped, “spins” from vertical and horizontal planes resulting in 70 unique measurements. Thus, this is sometimes referred to as “Spinorama” data. Audioholics has a great writeup on what these data mean (link here) and there is no sense in me trying to re-invent the wheel so I will reference you to them for further discussion. However, I will explain these curves lightly and provide my own spin on what they mean (pun totally intended). Sausalito Audio also has a good write-up on these curves here. Furthermore, you can find discussion in Dr. Floyd Toole’s book “Sound Reproduction”. Here’s my Amazon affiliate link if you want to purchase it and help me earn about 2% of the price. And, finally, here is a great video of Dr. Toole discussing the use of measurements to quantify in-room performance.In short, the CEA-2034 graphic below takes all the response measurements (horizontal and vertical) and applies weighting and averaging to sub-sets and can help provide an (accurate) prediction of the response in a typical room. If there is a single set of data to use in your purchase decision, this is probably it.Alternatively, click this arrow, if you want my quick take on what these curves mean without going to another site.The following are my takeaways from the data. More may be obvious to others or myself (with more time).There are various ways you can interpret the data, substituting the “dips” for “peaks” in analysis of the non-linearity. For example, I see the 400-500Hz and 700-800Hz regions as potential resonances (namely, the latter). However, if you view the 500Hz and 1kHz regions as dips, then one could argue the other bumps in response are not resonances. Looking at the nearfield data (in the Miscellaneous section), it appears the woofer has a notch at approximately 1kHz. I pulled up the driver data for the Scan-Speak 18W8545-1 and see there is a 2dB tall resonance spread from about 600-700Hz so I’m inclined to believe this really is a resonance, but not breakup, albeit small. Without disabling the other drive-units, however, it is hard to know for sure.The Listening Window lies mostly within the on-axis response but notably different at ~2.5kHz to 3.1kHz. This is within the region of the crossover between the midrange and the tweeter. You’ll notice in the above graphics that the off-axis response of the horizontal response yields a bump in this region compared to the on-axis response. Additionally, the RAAL is quite directional, vertically, due to its tall orientation. Therefore, it “beams” at approximately the frequency that equals the radiating height (70mm; 2.75 inches). Using the speed of sound and half-wavelength you can calculate the beaming point for this dimension as ~2.5kHz (SoS = 13500 under standard conditions: SoS/2/2.75 = 2449 Hz). So, the difference in the Listening Window vs the on-axis response is mostly caused by the horizontal response but the vertical directivity mismatch of the BMR midrange to the RAAL tweeter is a contributor as well.Outside of the two comments above, this speaker displays a very nice set of CEA-2034 curves with relatively wide directivity index curves. It has very wide horizontal directivity (which can be observed in the spectrogram and global plots presented earlier) with a horizontal response window of ±60° (non-normalized) up to about 10kHz. However, the vertical directivity is considerably narrower thanks to the RAAL tweeter’s height as mentioned above. The vertical window begins to narrow considerably above about 4kHz where the tweeter is the provider of response.Below is a breakout of the typical room’s Early Reflections contributors (floor bounce, ceiling, rear wall, front wall and side wall reflections). From this you can determine how much absorption you need and where to place it to help remedy strong dips from the reflection(s). Again, as a pointer to the wide horizontal envelope, notice how the Rear Wall Bounces Curve is relatively high in amplitude (for a front-facing tweeter, at least) until about 10kHz.And below is the Predicted In-Room response compared to a general Target curve equaling -1dB/octave.  The -1dB shelf below 300Hz effects the location of this target curve.  Additionally, this, speaker didn't sound as bright as this overlay may indicate.  Though, I did find it to be about 1dB too high in treble up until 10kHz where I wanted more ""air"".  The combination of what I heard and this shelf would probably put the target and predicted curves more in line with what I heard.  Also, the Predicted In-Room response is a function of radiation.  This speaker's tweeter does not radiate like a typical dome tweeter and therefore has a much broader horizontal dispersion pattern, which seemingly causes the Predicted In-Room high frequency response to be more flat.You may ask just how useful the above prediction is. Well, I’d be remiss for not delving in to that a little bit here. Please see my Analysis section below for discussion on this.Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Compression:Distortion and Compression measurements were completed in the nearfield (approximately 0.3 meters). However, SPL provided is relative to 1 meter distance.Extra Measurements:Nearfield measurements.Mic placed about 0.50 inches - relative to the baffle - from each drive unit and port. While I tried to make these as accurate in SPL as I could, I cannot guarantee the relative levels are absolutely correct so I caution you to use this data as a guide but not representative of actual levels (measuring in the nearfield makes this hard as a couple millimetres’ difference between measurements can alter the SPL level).Step-Response.Not Zoomed:Zoomed and annotated for the arrival time of each drive-unit’s impulse. You can see the drivers are not time-aligned and arrive distinctly separately. The difference in time between the woofer (2.5ms) and the midrange (1.33ms) is approximately 1.2ms. To put this in perspective, 1.2ms is approximately 16 inches.Subjective Evaluation:Before I dive in to the subjective feedback let me first give you the layout of my room…If the false wall part is odd to you, here's some background. I don't like seeing speakers when watching a movie. So, I built a false wall and used an acoustically transparent screen with speakers behind it. The wall is only 2x4's; no panels of wood or anything. Just a skeleton of a wall to give me something to attach the screen and acoustic treatment to. There is 2-inch wedge foam affixed to the 2x4 studs and between the false wall and back of the room are the front speakers (L/C/R & 18-inch subwoofers).My demo music:Subjective Analysis Setup:The speaker was aimed on-axis with the vertical listening axis between the mid and tweeter per Neumi’s manual.I used Room EQ Wizard (REW) and my calibrated MiniDSP UMIK-1 to get the volume on my AVR relative to what the actual measured SPL was in the MLP (~11 feet from the speakers). I varied it between 85-90dB, occasionally going up to the mid 90’s to see what the output capability was. In a poll I found most listen to music in this range.All speakers are provided a relatively high level of Pseudo Pink-Noise for a day or two - with breaks in between - in order to calm any “break-in” concerns.I demoed these speakers without a crossover and without EQ.Components: Oppo BDP-103 playing music off my thumb drive feeding signal via HDMI to a Denon AVR-X4000 which then feeds in to a refurbished Adcom GFA-545 for power.I listened to these speakers and made my subjective notes before I started measuring objectively. I did not want my knowledge of the measurements to influence my subjective opinion. This is important because I want to try to correlate the objective data with what I hear in my listening space in order to determine the validity of the measurement process. I try to do a few listening sessions over a couple days so I can give my ears a break and come back “fresh”.In the interest of time and due to no feedback discussing these matters, I am not providing photos of my notes (seems like no one cares and no sense in wasting my time if it’s not important to anyone). I did complete in-room measurements but sold the laptop without saving the results to my external drive so I am unable to provide those at this moment.Here’s the rundown of my subjective notes (in quotes) and where it fits with objective:Overall, I found the max SPL I could drive the speakers to was around 98-100dB at my listening position, depending on the music.  Which is quite loud at 11.5 feet!  The tell-tale for me here was the woofer ran out of mechanical excursion listening to Lauryn Hill's ""Doo Wop"".  I didn't notice any annoying distortion with the tracks I used.  I did hear some things that sounded different and now having seen the data, I wonder if the increased harmonic distortion between 2-4kHz might have been a contributor but I cannot say with any degree of certainty that it was.  Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy The Silence”: really nice punch in the bass. When the lead singer says “… oh my little girl…” I heard modulation in his voice that I have never heard before. That’s a good thing. It means, at least to me, the resolution of the speaker is extremely high. This was a common trend throughout the rest of my demo.Steve Winwood’s “Higher Love”: The panning drums on this track were very nice. I wrote “WOW” in my notes. I was jamming to this track at about 95dB and it sounded incredible. Chaka Khan’s voice at the end literally gave me goosebumps. Goosebumps. I did note there was something in the 800Hz region that I hadn’t noticed before and I didn’t have a specific way to describe it. It stood out; I wasn’t sure if it was good or bad. Looking at the data, I believe I may have been hearing the resonance I discussed earlier.The Cars “Magic”: Missing some “crackle (10k - 12kHz?)"". Looking at the data shows a falloff in response above 10kHz.The Police “Wrapped Around Your Finger”: This speaker reproduced the bass line better than anything I’ve ever heard to date. I noted that it seemed a bit excessive in the 2-3kHz region, though. I see in the data that the off-axis response is a bit brighter in this region but I’m not sure if that’s the reason I heard what I heard or not.Peter Gabriel’s “Sledgehammer”: I could hear inflection in his voice that I’d never heard before which I felt was, again, attributed to the HF response.Portugal The Man’s “Feel It Still”: The chord progression on this track… I could feel it coming at me. Like it was coming out of the speakers. Crazy.John Mayer’s cover of Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin”: I see audiophile types say “you want to feel like you’re in the audience”. My response is typically “yea, if the recording is made in a way that will allow it”. The easy example is a singer with auto-tune: he/she shouldn’t sound “real” at all. But, sure, if the recording is of good quality and “real” was the objective then using that as a reference for a real sound is just fine. I feel this recording is one of those. But I haven’t heard a speaker yet that “puts me there” like these do. It was so cool, I even got my wife to listen in the sweet spot. Of course, she said “sounds cool” and went on her way. But the next day she had that song on one of her playlists. So… I take that as a win for this speaker.Paul Simon “Kodachrome”: Drums on the left side of the stage were clearly behind the speaker. Though, I did find something to be a bit resonant in the 250-300Hz region. The majority of the data doesn’t reveal any reason for me having heard this. However, when I look back at the normalized horizontal response I can see a small bump right in this region as the response trends off-axis. I am honestly very impressed that a) I heard this and b) there is correlating data. I keep saying… if the data doesn’t show it then either something is wrong or you’re not looking at the right data. This is a prime example of the latter.Tears For Fears “Everybody Wants To Rule The World”: perfect ~160hz vocal tone. “Behind You”… “Be-hind”… the “beee” portion of this word sounded a bit boomy. Might be the 250-300Hz resonance noted above. Might also be my imagination. Or might be the way it is supposed to sound. I believe it’s resonance, though. The breakdown portion starting around 2:40 has a three-chord progression; low notes. I have listened to this song thousands of times… thousands… it is my favorite song of all time… and I have never noticed the “pluck” of those notes until I heard it on these speakers. Of course, now that I’ve heard it, I notice it on other speakers… but I credit the BMRs for making that possible.Norah Jones “Tell Yer Mama”: Backup vocalist on the left is as wide as my room with the speakers placed about 3.5 feet from the side walls.I chose not to run Dirac Live with these speakers due to time constraints. But with a little bit of EQ on the 4-8kHz region (where I felt it was about 1dB too high) and with room correction, I can only imagine how much better my listening impression would have been.Bottom LineThese speakers are awesome. The tonality revealed things in songs I’d never heard before (in only one case did I find that to be a negative). The resolution reveals little details such as slight inflections in voices and even accentuates the breathing-in of a vocalist before they begin their next line. It was a new experience for me to hear these kind of details. The soundstage is incredibly large and well balanced and the reflections in the room help to extend the soundstage to a size I’ve yet to hear from another speaker to date.For the kit price of about $1000, I can’t imagine anything coming close to the value of this speaker in DIY form. I would have no qualms at all paying the kit price and ordering the flat pack and assembling this myself for about $1500/pair. And if I had more money and less time I wouldn’t mind ordering them complete from Salk. No matter what your experience level or desire to build, I think these speakers are a no brainer for their price.However, I would like to hear what these speakers can do if one was to cover the tweeter so as to make it a small square rather than as tall as it is. That would theoretically bring the beaming point up to match the horizontal dispersion pattern and I would really be interested to see how that additional vertical window of dispersion would help (or potentially hurt) these speakers.Objectively speaking, one potentially large concern (emphasis on potentially; your mileage may vary based on use) is the very low sensitivity of 83.2dB at 2.83v/1m.  Therefore, I also would like to see what this speaker would be like if the BMR had a higher sensitivity.  When I tested one of Tectonics' 2 inch BMR speakers some years back ([link here](""https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/driveunits/tectonic-elements-tebm35c10-4-miniature-bmr-driver/"")) I was very impressed with the linearity of response even beyond the typical beaming point.  However, the abysmal sensitivity of that speaker kept it from being one I could recommend for typical DIY use.  The BMR used in this speaker, too, has a very low sensitivity and therefore all the other drive units' output capability are brought down in level to match it.  The Scan woofer used here has a sensitivity higher sensitivity of about 87dB but baffle step compensation would also bring the sensitivity down some.  Therefore, the woofer would need to be upgraded to something with higher sensivity.  The Scan-Speak Illuminator would be a pretty good alternative, considering it has a bit more linear excursion than the one used in this speaker design.  Of course, the Illuminator is an easy $100/driver more than the Classic woofer.  Basically, if the sensitivity of this speaker were higher... that would make for a very top-shelf speaker but would also drive the cost up a bit more and you begin to reach the point where the value (price per performance) may take a hit.Another aspect that would be interesting to investigate is the time-alignment of the drivers.  As shown previously, these drivers are not time-aligned.  Personally speaking, it's not easy for me to notice smaller differences in time alignment in absolute terms.  But, when I have a DSP and the ability to adjust time delay manually using pink noise or test tones (for high frequency and low frequency, respectively) I almost always can manually nail the correct time delay values when I compare to a microphone measurement.  So, while maybe not incredibly obvious, timing does matter and I - as well as others I know - can hear when a drive unit is in time/phase with another one when given the opportunity to make adjustments manually.  Correct time alignment at the crossover always helps the coherency; that's how I am able to detect when I am ""in time"" or not via DSP settings.  So, I have to believe that if this speaker had all the drivers aligned in time that the result would be another level of improvement.At any rate, kudos to Mr. Murphy on a very well designed speaker!The End / SupportIf you like what you see here and want to help me keep it going, you can donate via this PayPal Contribute link.

A member in Europe wanted it measured so paid for me to purchase one for testing in US.  They are quite hard to find in US but one online store had it.  They list the retail price at US $430 but have it on sale for US $170 for a pair.This is very small speaker looking like outdoor units but it is not:The application seems to be for wall-mounting for ""ambient"" or surround use as you can tell from mounting points:Typical of the class it is a lightweight speaker made out of plastic.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 800 measurement which resulted in error rate between 1 and 2%.Temperature was 62 degrees F. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.The grill was not quick to take off so I left it on.  Alas even with a flashlight I could not see where the tweeter was.  So I eyeballed it and I think I got it a bit wrong.  See measurements below.Canton Plus GXL.3 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Well this is not good.  We are spoiled these days in that many speakers regardless of price attempt to produce a better on-axis response.  We have two large resonances as indicated by the severe peaking.  And messy crossover integration as far as beam width of the tweeter vs woofer.Here is our early window reflections:As you see, the off-axis curves in different colors is wildly different which means this speaker will sound different in different rooms.  And equalization would be more difficult.Predicted in-room response is a bit better but still not ideal:Maybe some of you are better than me but looking at the above graph I couldn't quickly tell you how the speaker would ""sound"" given the multiple aberrations.Impedance graph shows the more severe resonance around 1.2kHz:Here are the distortion measurements:Bass distortion is kept in check so it should be able to play loud without falling apart.Directivity and beamwidth are obviously areas of concern:I marveled at the beautify of the above graph though!    What looks good to the eye is unfortunately not good for the ear in this case.Vertical directivity shows my slight error in setting the reference:You can see that I am a hair above center line of the radiation peak.  Regardless, point this tweeter right at you as otherwise you will fall in a ditch in lower treble.Canton GXL.3 Speaker Listening TestsI put the GXL.3 in my usual 2-channel system location and propped it up in the back to be level and pointed it at my listening location.  Playing the first female track was not satisficing.  It was simultaneously tubby and have too much highs.  I applied one filter for the top end resonance and another for 1.2 kHz.  That helped but still was not good.  Right before putting it aside, I decided to also go after the tubbiness in bass:Oh wow!  That made a big difference!  The tubbiness disappears and the speaker actually started to sound cleaner and warmer!  Likely not asking the little woofer to play these lower notes helped.  Once there, I could drive it hard without it showing stress.While not annoyingly so, there was still high frequency accentuation resulting in lisping (extension of ""s"" sound in vocals).  More filtering and tuning will be needed than what I eyeballed to get this under control.ConclusionsOut of the box the measurements and subjective listening experience of the GXL.3 are poor.  Equalization however had a remarkable effect in getting down to some ""good bones"" in this speaker.  Would it be something I would go and buy even with EQ?  No.  But if you have it, I suggest trying the above EQ and you can get reasonably good sound out of it.I cannot recommend the Canton Plus GXL.3 speaker.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly sent to me by the company for testing.  As best as I can tell, it is sold by the company direct and costs €1,800 per pair which translates to US $1,950 as of this writing.  Interestingly the cost is inclusive of any import duties and taxes!  The warranty is a generous 10 years.The S400 nails the industrial design, showing a highly differentiated and modern look in a loudspeaker:Success in speaker business is 80% marking and I think Buchardt has nailed that with this look and feel.The back panel of a speaker is usually boring but not in this case:Instead of a port we have a passive radiator which is said to eliminate the noise from the port.  In listening tests, that seems to be case with me only hearing nice low frequencies and not much else from the back.Terminals are nicely spaced and easy to use.The S400 is designed in Denmark but manufactured in China.  I was a bit surprised that at this price point is not locally produced.  Not that this matters to me personally.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are referenced to the tweeter axis with frequency resolution of 2.7 Hz.As an aside, the S400 has been measured with the same Klippel NFS system so makes for an interesting comparison between my data and theirs.To Center or Not to Center -- that is the question!The manual states that the listening axis vertically should be between the tweeter waveguide and woofer.  This is contrary to my usual measurement standard of tweeter axis.  To avoid the food fights we get every time this comes up, I actually measured the S400 twice: once at tweeter axis and then at the recommended ""acoustic center.""  I did this both in-room (not shown) and with full NFS scan.  Here is the latter comparison of on-axis with both overlayed:Please ignore the response in red beyond 8 kHz or so.  When the reference axis is not the tweeter, the estimation of sound field becomes less accurate at higher frequency in NFS system requiring far more measurement points than I was willing to spend to measure it.  Presumably if fixed, it will tilt back up and be similar to tweeter axis.Anyway, the direct axis in my opinion suffers when you select the mid-point between the two drivers with the dip starting at crossover frequency becoming more pronounced.  So for the rest of the measurements, I opted to use the tweeter axis data.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:The on-axis/listening window is fairly flat and desirable.  What is not is the peak at 518 Hz or so which as you will see in other measurements is very persistent.  Company measurements show the same although not as exaggerated.Despite the highly visible waveguide intending to limit the directivity (how wide the sound spreads) of the tweeter to match that of the woofer, it seems to not be at optimal position relative crossover frequency.  The same is seen in horizontal directivity plot:Notice how the woofer is getting more directional with its soundfield shrinking.  The tweeter than takes over but it does so a bit later, causing that dip and mismatch.  Company measurements are a bit different and more optimized.  So maybe there is sample to sample variation in the crossover?Predicted in-room response in a hypothetical room shows the same issues we have seen so far:Our waterfall/CSD plot shows the resonance issue around 500 Hz:Vertical directivity shows that the optimal axis is the tweeter:If you go up in angle, you hit that dip as I showed in my introductory measurement of reference axis.Interesting to see the higher amplitude low frequency response above axis.  I am assuming this is due to woofer being on top but there should not be that much directivity there in such low frequencies.  Maybe it is the cabinet that is radiating on one side more than the other?This is a low impedance speaker for a much of the frequency band:And because of that, it stays at that low impedance even when phase angle goes negative and positive, creating a more difficult load for the amplifier.Finally distortion measurements:Speaker Listening TestsThe first impression was not very positive.  Going through my track list, not much excited me.  I put in a filter at the resonance point and that helped fair but but I was still left empty.  My reference tracks all sounded good but hardly any sounded great.I physically examined the speaker and boy does this cabinet breath.  It is constantly being excited by whatever it plays.  On other speakers, only a few frequencies excited them but here, the cabinet is more like how a music instrument acts, being part of the show.  Researching online, it seems the cabinet has no bracing and is only using half inch MDF?Upper bass delivery was good (e.g. in techno music) but deep bass at elevated levels would cause severe bottoming out of the woofer.  I swapped the S400 for the Revel M16 and found it having the same issue.  But otherwise, it sounded excellent and much better performer on my reference tracks.  The M16 costs half as much so this did not bode well for the S400.I no longer have the JBL HDI-1600 but from memory it did a lot better than the Revel M16 in handling deep bass.  In addition, the JBL aced all of my reference tracks as well.I should say that overall sound of the S400 is pleasant and warm.  And often times I would admire mid to high frequency transient notes.  So there is merit here.ConclusionsWhenever I get equipment from companies, I hold my breath as I measure them, hoping hard that they do well.  Here, the Buchardt objectively performs reasonably well.  At this price though, I expect a more stout cabinet, free of clear resonances and copious vibration.  And with the waveguide being the center of attention, it would be good to have perfection at the crossover point.Combined with the subjective listening experience which left me mostly unsatisfied, I cannot recommend the Buchardt S400.  I hope the company makes some improvements to the design as the have a good overall recipe.  Alternatively, they could decide I don't know what I am listening to and go about their business.  EDIT: on further reflection, I think I did not do a good job of highlighting what the Buchardt S400 does well.  And that is excellence in a lot of the objective measurements.  Indeed its performance there is better than some speakers I have liked and recommended!  As usual, objective data is much more reliable than any subjective impressions I have of a speaker.  So I would say put the S400 on your target list of speakers to evaluate as it certainly passes the bar of being objectively good.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.As you all know, panthers hunt and eat live animals.

It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $399 for a pair.The look and feel of the 12.1 is definitely above the budget category:The back is rather pedestrian but more beefy than other speakers in its class:Overall a good look for the speaker.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Using computational acoustics, far-field response is computed and that is what I present. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of about 1%. Clean high frequency response is responsible for ease of measurement in this regard.Reference axis is approximately the center of the tweeter. Grill was not used.Wharfedale Diamond 12.1 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:The all important on-axis response (black) is almost flat which is great.  There is a bit of a valley around 2 to 3 kHz which unfortunately gets deeper off axis making directivity rather poor there.  We can see it better in early window reflections:It takes a rather severe penalty there.  Lack of a waveguide causes the woofer beamwidth to be narrower than tweeter's around the crossover frequencies.  Fortunately you can use a thick rug to absorb the floor reflections like I have.  And high ceilings help too with the ceiling bounce.Putting the two together we get the expected results which is good:Near-field measurements show that this is one of the rarer designs that keeps the internal port and cabinet resonances at bay:We routinely see these resonances being higher in frequency and competing with the tweeter/woofer response.  Not here.  The port does its thing to extend low frequencies and that is it.  As it should be.Back to directivity, we see its measure better here:We see the beam width narrowing (woofer) then widening (tweeter).  One benefit here though is that beam width is 20 or so degrees wider in each direction than is typical of these speakers.  There is on going discussion as to trade off here.Here is our color 3-D map of the same:There is that narrowing of the high frequencies (same beaming but now applied to tweeter) and I wonder if this makes the speaker less bright to my ears.Here is vertical with a bit more allowance for height than normal:And our 3-D directivity at three frequencies:Someone talked me into expanding my distortion measurements down to 76 dBSPL which is making the presentation hard but here it is anyway:During measurements I did not hear much distortion above deep bass which indicates good power handling.  Here is the same as a percentage:Edit: forgot to post the impedance:Wharfedale 12.1 Listening TestsI powered the speakers in my usual far field setup and started to listen.  One track, then two, then three.  I am not hearing much to complain about!  Yet we had that directivity error and some lower treble dip.  Brought out the EQ to fill those in:This made the vocals, especially that of females, to stand out more which I liked.  And added a bit of resolution to them as is typical of this type of boost.  On some tracks I thought there was a bit extra brightness but overall, I liked it better with EQ than without.Power handling was excellent.  Speaker simply doesn't do what it can't do, i.e. deep bass.  As a result even with a single speaker, I could fill it with a ton of watts and it kept getting louder until I got scared before it did!  There was some amount of tactile bass which was surprising and welcomeAt this point I was puzzled that we had some flaws in measurements yet I am not able to put my finger on anything.  So I pulled out my Revel M106 speaker and played it.  The M106 was definitely a step up with much better resolution when it came to delicate details.  It was clearly a better experience.  That speaker is four times the price though so I changed it out for Revel M16.  The M16 has a boosted upper bass and this was quite audible, creating a warmer, albeit slightly muddy sound without correction for my room mode which it activates.  The M16 retails for double the price but you can get it for less discounted.  Still, I didn't feel that it provided much of any advantage over Wharfedale 12.1 in this quick comparison.ConclusionsTechnical we have some technical flaws in the midst of good performance otherwise in the 12.1.  Objectively this stands out a lot but in listening tests in my room at least with floor absorption and high ceilings, I was not able to identify it.  Indeed I was stomped in trying to find much of any fault with the speaker.  Directivity errors though mean that speaker sound will more room dependent so your experience may vary somewhat from mine.  Still, I think Wharfedale has done a very good job here.Overall, I am going to recommend the Wharfedale Diamond 12.1.  You could almost push me to give it the highest honors had it not been due to directivity errors.  It provides a quandary with respect to audibility of such flaws versus some other trade offs.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

The Kit was kindly built by @Rick Sykora.  Meniscus Audio will be selling the kit and a portion of the proceeds goes to family of Jeff Bagby.  The kit cost starts at $630 plush shipping for a pair.This is a three-way design and built out of ultra dense and thick MDF:As you can see, there is an oval passive radiator in the back.  It was a pleasure to have a pair of binding posts where I could get my fingers in there.  Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: The on-axis response looks very good.  The only exceptions are the perturbation around 1.7 kHz and a bit of rising energy in the upper end.  The dip at 1.7 kHz remains in off-axis as well:Resulting predicted in room response is what we already know:So very good overall.Digging into the source of that dip it appears to be the bottom end of the midrange driver:Speaking of mid-range, it seems to be playing louder than it can without distortion:I don't usually see correlations between frequency response errors and THD percentage but we have one here at 1.7 kHz.Impedance is around 5.5 ohm which is higher (better) than typical small speaker, putting less stress on the amplifier:The mid-range provides wide beamwidth in the mid-range:Here is the same as a heatmap:The 3-way design makes vertical placement less critical:And here is the waterfall:Speaker Listening TestsHaving seen the measurements before listening, I expected the sound to be good but it wasn't!  It sounded muffled in the mid-range.  Fortunately I quickly realized I had the EQ on from last test I was doing so turned that off and all was well with the universe.    The experience was very good albeit with a touch too much upper end energy.  I put it this way as opposed to saying ""bright"" as the treble response is not high enough to be annoying. It was close enough that I did not bother to EQ but you may want to. I toed the speaker out a bit and while that did reduce the highs a bit, I had a preference for the more clear direct sound.  Anyway, it is something you can play with.The Integrity is very inefficient by the way requiring me to turn up the volume to very high levels.  Fortunately it handled the power well and could get loud despite a single speaker playing. My subsonic bass test tracks which I call ""speaker killers"" earned their designation though causing massive distortion.   You better have a filter for such bass notes or not have as powerful of an amp as I have.  Fortunately the woofer recovered as if nothing had happened and continued playing.Note that 99% of my music and even those with heavy bass don't have the subsonic energy that cause the problem above.ConclusionsI must say, I was very nervous going into this review.  The work is for a good cause but so is transparency in speaker reviews.  I had my fingers crossed that it would measure and sound well.

It is on kind loan from a local member.  This specific speaker came out around 2002 I think and cost US $3,200 around that time.  Being patterned after the famous BBC LS 5/9 speakers, I imagine the design is still the same to this day.  The latest model seems to go by 30.1 designation.The Harbeth logo was in danger of coming off so the owner pulled it off.  Here is what it looks like (I know, very bland):It barely fit in my little photo booth so not very large.  The grill is tricky to remove so I did not attempt to do so.  I am told the recommendation is to use it with the grill so that is how I measured it.The back panel shows ability for bi-wiring:Love the bit about the speaker being in their log book.  Well, its measurements are now in our log book as well.  Let's get into measurements.  Since this is a passive monitor, I followed the CEA 2034 recommendation of feeding it 2.83 volts.  Temperature was a balmy 57 degrees.  Altitude was 13 feet above sea level.  Acoustic center of the speaker was determined following ITC-2025 Part B standard (I used my Mitutoyo micrometer).  Any wind in the lab was self-generated due to previous meal.CEA-2034 Spinorama MeasurementsAs usual we start with our master dashboard of the speaker which is its ""spin"" data:I have gotten requests for ""clean"" versions of this picture so I have avoided making notations on it.  Let me know if that is a good or bad idea.There is a lot of controversy around the so called ""BBC dip"" where around the crossover frequency the on-axis response drops fair bit.  Tom Holman of the T in THX recommended that the same dip be implemented in Audessey Room EQ!  A mistake in my opinion.  Anyway, we see the dip starting around 3 kHz.  Getting a 3-D plot of that region gives us this complex sound intensity:I don't think this is what you want in a speaker.  Put another way, it is the classic engineering work of calling a defect a feature.    We can see the havoc it plays on our early window (and sound power) directivity:Why would I want to have a suck out in that region of audible spectrum?  I let you google forever to read the fights back and forth.Taking into account the direct and early window reflections to predict the in-room response, we get:The dip is there of course around the crossover frequency.  And general unevenness.   The overall tilt is quite exaggerated so perhaps good for people with high sensitivity to high frequencies, it would tame the harshness in that region in the recording.Basic Speaker MeasurementsLet's start with impedance and phase measurements:Specification is 6 ohms.  Standard requires staying about 80% (?) of this value which would be 4.8 ohm.  If you cheat a bit it gets there.  Worst case phase is around 100 Hz which impedance around 9 ohms.  This make the effect load to be much lower (i.e. the difficulty that the amplifier sees).Sensitivity (""efficiency"") is almost always given as a single number by the manufacturer but it varies based on frequency:In most of the frequency range the actual sensitivity is better than specified 85 dB which is good.You all seem to like colorful 3-D graphs so here is the so called ""waterfall:""I don't trust this graph much.  For one thing, these graphs can be manipulated to show any and all things.  More importantly though, the Klippel NFS system I use is great for measuring frequency response but on tests like this, its structure can resonate with the speaker, which would show up as its own slices above.  Maybe after I test more speakers I get confidence on reliability of this (rather useless) measurement.Finally, step function seems to be a popular item so here it is, zoomed properly now to show the step response of each driver:The tweeter is always ""faster"" so it generates a response first.  It is swinging negative which means it is out of phase with the woofer which takes its time to generate its response to the right of it at opposite phase.  There is discontinuity between the two (around 2.8 milliseconds). Advanced Speaker MeasurementsHere is the rest of the bits for those interested:Full spin data is enclosed.Correlation With Other MeasurementsStereophile measured a much more recent version and reported this for frequency response:Focus on the black line only.  It looks a heck of a lot better than our graph.  Almost flat and smooth on Axis!  Well, that is not what is really going on.First the easy part, it has the same bass hump as we do (although their measurements usually exaggerates this due to their close-in measurement technique):We show a dip post our peak in low frequency but they don't.  The reason is that they are using gated measurements to eliminate echos and that hugely reduces resolution in a few hundred hertz (to one or two data points).  Past that, they do have the dip but they show such a low resolution compressed graph that it is not nearly as visible.  We both show the couple of peaks close to 10 kHz.Overall, given the radically different measurement setups, I say the correlation is very good.  Our data is much higher resolution than theirs.Listening TestsNo time or setup yet for listening tests.  Will do some and report back later.ConclusionsIt is interesting to measure these ""classic"" speakers to finally put some hard data behind their objective performance.  As expected the halo is more positive than the objective data indicates.  The cost of these speakers is way up there.  I appreciate being built in England and needing to have good supply of bear for works after hours but it is a lot of money for this kind of measured performance.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Had some great sushi at my favorite spot when I went to pick this and other speakers.  It was over US $60 for lunch!  While I feel satisfied, I also feel poor.

It is on kind loan from a member.  Despite being produced in US, the CBM-170 is priced quite reasonably at US $384/pair.  It is on sale as of this writing for even less at US $298 a pair.While not much prettier than the next budget speaker, the CBM-170 is a larger and seemingly fancier packaging:It is a classic formula for a 2-way speaker.  Sadly, it lacks a waveguide to better integrated the tweeter and woofer at crossover point.  Here is the back panel of the speaker:Not much to complain about in this price range.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections. It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed.Around 500 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field across full frequency response of 20 to 20 kHz. Final database of measurements and data is 750 megabytes in size.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:From a number of listening tests I have performed to correlate measurements to what we hear, I have learned that the baseline for tonality gets set around 200 Hz region.  So I drew that line and as we see, the response starts to peak above that starting around 1 kHz and keeps going.  As such, I expect the speaker to sound bright. The problem of a small tweeter and larger woofer without directivity control (e.g. waveguide) is seen above but magnified more when we look at directivity index:The dashed blue line is difference between what you hear directly from the speaker and important (loudest) reflections around the room.  Ideally these two match each other, sans a gradual reduction in high frequencies which makes the graph point up.  Here, the blue line deviates a lot from the straight line meaning the off-axis response is colored relative to direct sound.   This makes this bit of advertising from the company strange:Above measurements don't point to accurate sound.  And certainly not a benchmark for bookshelf speakers.We can predict how this speaker will sound by mixing the right ratio of direct and indirect sound from the speaker:Once again we see the extra energy at higher frequencies.As I note on the graph, this is a good way to sell speakers as at first it sounds much more ""detailed.""  But over time, that extra sharpness can become grating. We are done characterizing the speaker at this point.  The rest is for speaker nerds.Basic Speaker MeasurementsMeasurement of the impedance shows a dip to below 4 ohm in bass frequencies so you better have more capable amplification than you think you need:Working on refining my distortion graphs, here is a set at two different magnification levels:And here is the waterfall for those you love to see this pretty graph:Advanced Speaker MeasurementsSpeaker Listening TestsEven though this is not sold as a near-field speaker, I have a better setup on my desk to perform AB comparisons.  I compared the CBM-170 SE against the Pioneer SP-BS22.  Despite being a larger speaker and hence has more bass, the dominant impression of the Ascend speaker is that it is bright.  It sounds ""detailed"" to be sure but will give you a shave if you let it.  If you are using this speaker without broad EQ, then I think you will get tired of its sound very quickly after the initial ""high.""To be clear though, it has much better power capability than the Pioneer so the Pioneer doesn't win on all factors.One disappointment was the amount of cabinet flex and resonance.  There was a ton of it with Ascend, matching the same amount of the much cheaper Pioneer.ConclusionsYou are paying a premium for a US made speaker here, with possibly better parts.  Overall though, the excess energy in high frequencies combined with some directivity issues is problematic.  I suggest looking elsewhere for a better design.  As is, there is not much to get me excited about the Ascend CMB-170 SE so I am not going to recommend it.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I was hoping to become filthy rich on the backs of your donations.

It was kindly sent to me by @Mudjock as tested.  The kit by itself goes for US $300 including Prime shipping.  Unusual for a speaker kit, it comes with everything you need including the speaker box.  As built the response is too hot in the tweeter (I think) and hence the mod: https://sites.google.com/view/sehlin-sound-solutions/hivi-diy-3-1-modificationsI must say I like the white finish on a DIY speaker better than black:Please don't mind the little nicks.  The crossover had come loose in shipping and I had to take the speaker apart to affix it.The mid-range throw me off as I first thought those two little wires are debris so I proceed to try to grab then with my needle nose pliers!  Fortunately I realized in time and didn't try to pull them off.  So if you have grabby hands around your household, you better make a grill or buy a different speaker.While I was in there, I took pictures of the drivers and crossover:The tweeter wires had come off also.  I thought I tighten the clips before sliding them on and was disappointed by how soft the tabs on the tweeters were.  They started to bend and felt like they would fall off you did that once or twice.FYI despite my addition of double sided tape (admittedly low quality ones), the crossover came loose again.  So best to think of a more solid way to mount them.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was enough to compute the sound field of the speaker within 1% error except region above 12 kHz or so.  This may have caused a bit more of a steep drop off in that region than reality.Temperature was 75 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:On-axis response is not ruler flat but not too bad either.  I tend to like areas I can pull down in upper bass than needing to push them up.Off-axis response shows more clearly a dip in mid-range response:You can see this more clearly in near-field response of all the drivers/port:Low response of the midrange between 1 and 2 kHz has an unwanted shelf causing lower energy there.Predicted in-room response is one that we could guess:I was impressed by low levels of distortion:Distortion in bass usually goes off scale but here is very well managed until we drop to below 40 Hz.Beamwidth is typical but somewhat uneven:Here are the directivity measurements:EDIT: here is the impedance graph:Speaker Listening TestsOut of the box, the speaker sounded very good but with tonality that is a bit on the bright side.  Upper bass can also be a bit tubby just like the measurements indicate.I usually have an EQ at 100 hz for a room mode but here, it actually helped the response so I turned that off.  I then put in a dip at 700 and 3000 Hz (1 and 2 dB respectively with Q of 2).  The latter was effective across all content.  The 700 Hz was a matter of taste.I was most impressed by how clean the Hivi 3.1 could play.  I could push it up to reference levels without a hint of distortion with body sensations to boot!  My ""speaker killer"" tests nearly did not impact the Hivi.  It did not try to reproduce the deep bass too much and this was its savior.  No bottoming out.  No static.   Most excellent.Helped with my room mode at 100 Hz and tiny bit of EQ, this speaker produced delightful sound, albeit with still some slant toward highs.  The subjective performance pushed my my preference one notch relative to measurements.ConclusionsI had low expectations going into this review and boy, was I surprised.  No, there is no perfection here and without EQ, you may find the sound a bit annoying.  But small amount of EQ fixes most of that and delivers a speaker with impressive dynamics and very balanced design.  It is able to outperform many budget speakers in its ability to play loud and not bottom out/distort.Assuming you do use EQ and want the sanctification of building a DIY speaker, the Hivi 3.1 with Sehlin gets my strong recommendation!Note that if your room doesn't provide the bass enhancement that mine did, your experience may not quite match mine.  I can only report on what I hear in the same setting as other speakers which happened to help this speaker.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.$440.

It is kindly sent by a member for testing.  It costs US $798 each.The Duo as the name indicates, is the doubled up Sierra Luna speaker which I just reviewed:As with its smaller brother, it is a very solid and heavy enclosure for its size.  As noted, it can also be put on its side as a center speaker:I chose to measure and listen to it in vertical configuration as this configuration usually performs very poorly in horizontal setting.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:And we have flaws coming out of our ear, pun intended!  Do we not want transparency when it comes the all important mid-range where the single voice is?  Why would anyone want to mess up the recording like this?  Yes, there is more bass than the smaller version but the rest of the problems remain.  One of the main design failures as with the smaller one is the port:The larger enclosure did not change the nature of these.Off-axis response is very poor as well:Combination is as bad as one would expect:Beam width is good due to small woofers relative to size of the tweeter:Colorized version of the same though shows the very uneven response:Vertically the optimal listening angle is razor thin:If you used this speaker horizontally then where the above becomes your horizontal response, you better sit at the axis of tweeter and not move one bit!  Never mind about anything else sitting to your left and right.Really, not much else matters but here they are anyway:Ascend Sierra Luna Duo Speaker Listening TestsI measured the speaker last night and listened to it today.  Not remembering much about the measurement other than port issues, I thought maybe the addition of more bass improves the experience.  It did not.  What bass there is, is not pleasant.  There is less brightness though although there is still plenty of lispy.  The worse part was that the speaker ruined my entire audiophile playlist.  These are tracks that sound good on majority of speakers (hence the reason they are used at shows and such).  Here though, the experience was terrible.  I would never use them with this speaker to show off my system.  I am sorry abut I can't put words to the total because it is such a mess.Attempting to fix the issues other than removing the room mode at 100 Hz was not close to making this speaker pleasurable.To makes sure I was not in a bad mood, I replaced the Luan Duo with Revel M105.  Wow, or wow!  I was back in heaven enjoying beautiful tonality and clarity.  While they are a bit wider, they are actually shorter than the Luna Duo.ConclusionsThe Ascent Sierra Luna Duo is one of the worse measuring and sounding I have tested out of near 100 this year!  Company says this about it:Oh, I can ""turn back.""  You don't even have to ask me.  If I had bought these speakers, I would turn around and ship them back.  How can the designer be so blind to the objective and subjective faults of this speaker?  Has he not measured or heard a properly designed speaker?  ""Refinement?""  In this speaker?  You have to be kidding me.  ""Realistic?""  Like to what?  An AM radio?  So no, I need no ""warning"" from that tweeter which can't manage a flat response or one that is inline with the rest of the response.Needless to say, I can not in any form or fashion recommend the Ascend Sierra Luna Duo.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you are an American citizen, please go and vote.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Hmmm, seems like we keep hitting on speakers that shelf the mid to highs for some reason, this type lowering it.  I checked other reviews and this matched another measurement posted so it is not instrumentation error.Early window aggravates this some:Resulting in this predicted in-room response:Strange to see a mass market product opt for this type of high frequency output as it is opposite of conventional retail wisdom of ""what sells in a showroom.""Distortion-test shows some issue around 600 Hz:It is a resonance that also appears in impedance graph:Edit: adding directivity information:Speaker Listening TestsI always start my testing with select few female tracks as they quickly tell me if the speaker is too bright, lispy, etc.  The first couple of tracks sounded fine but then I played the third standard track, the Eva Cassidy Ain't no Sunshine.  Right at the marker something bad happened:She takes a breath and starts singing.  On Elac Uni-Fi I heared a rather loud squeak instead of that breath! I can't it to words but the artifact actually sounded louder than her voice which came on an instant after that.I remember during the measurement prep, I could hear a high pitched sound in the middle of the sweep.  Thought maybe this was the same thing.  To narrow down the frequency, I cut off everything above 1 kHz and problem remained.  I inverted and cut off the lows and problem went away.  I got it close to around 600 Hz but couldn't get the exact frequency.  So went back to the distortion graph and found that frequency and notched it out:90% of the problem vanished!  This speaker uses a new woofer and seems like it has a nasty resonances in this area that Eva's breath energizes.  The artifact can be heard on the youtube version but not as strongly:I stopped testing at this point.  As a confirmation, I played the same track on Revel M105 and it sounded wonderful with zero issue (I have used the same track to test at least 100 speakers).ConclusionsWhat a shock to discover what I did with this speaker.  Usually resonances color the sound.  They don't become instruments on their own.  But that is what happened here.  And in a design from the talented Andrew Jones.   Given how easy it was to detect the issue in multiple measurements, it should have been caught and fixed.As far as I am concerned, this is a show-stopper, broken design.  Don't know how else to put it.  FYI Eva Cassidy album is standard issue at all audio shows in multiple suites so it is not like it is some oddball track one never sees.  I guess it is possible this one speaker sample has an issue in which case I encourage Elac to try to replicate this problem and let us know what is going on.For now, I can not recommend the Elac Uni-Fi 2.0.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

And that includes free shipping if you are in US.  So quite a bargain if it performs well.Being unfinshed MDF, there is not much to look at as far as asthetics:But there are some technical points to note.  First is the inclusion of a waveguide around the tweeter to bring the ""directivity"" (spread of the sound wave) closer to that of the woofer at crossover point (woofer gets directional there).  The tweeter is also moved closer to woofer to reduce the center to center distance as to improve vertical directivity.  The waveguide is NOT notched however.  The woofer simply overlaps it.  The MDF cabinet felt quite stout to me both in feel and in use.  There is certainly more to it than what you get in budget speakers.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are referenced to the tweeter axis with frequency resolution of 2.7 Hz.Due to reduced bass response (I think), the accuracy of projected frequency response degraded a lot below 70 Hz.  It was an unusual development which I think was caused both by the speaker output and longer distance I used to measure it.  So don't be concerned about that portion of the graph not being as clean as it normally is.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: My first reaction to the graph was ""this is not good.""  But there are really two things that visually look bad as noted on the measurement.  The bass level is generally lower and there is peaking around 700 Hz.  Sensitivity is on the low side as well depending on where you draw the line (i.e. what frequency range you average).Those issues aside, for a budget speaker the response seems reasonably flat in the critical area.  Directivity is reasonable as well around crossover point.Sum of important ""early"" reflections shows rather smooth response, sans the aforementioned 700 Hz resonance:Predicted response in a simulated ""average"" listening room reflects what we have already learned:Impedance is rather high for a bookshelf speaker which is easier on the amplifier:Most of the time we see impedance dips below 4 ohm.I didn't note it on the graph but there is a ""kink"" in the phase and amplitude response around problematic 700 Hz.  This does not show up as harmonic distortion though:Instead we see the rising distortion at crossover point which could either be the woofer going too high, or tweeter going too low.Here is the in-room response (of the lab) and absolute level of distortion, this time averaged to 1/20 Hz to make it easier to read:You can see the same shelving of the bass response, 700 Hz boost, etc.  Worst case response above 1 kHz is 40 dB below listening level.Horizontal directivity shows that you don't want to toe in/out the speaker too much:Waterfall display shows the pesky resonance at 700 Hz:Speaker Listening TestI was set to not like this speaker, biased by what I saw in the spinorama and that turned out to be the case with the first female vocal track I played.  The sound was a bit dull and tonally wrong for a female voice.  Before going further, I thought I dial in a parametric filter around 700 Hz and see if it improves things:That it did!  Detailed improved as did tonality.  I ran through a bunch of my reference tracks that sound good on my system (Revel Salon 2 speakers) and almost all translated well to this little speaker!  The sound was quite enjoyable and not too bright.  Interestingly, there was good bass there.  Even better was the fact that this speaker could play loud, really loud.  I am talking filling a very large open space with just one speaker playing and no sign of bottoming out!I think there is something clever going on with bass here.  But having it be at lower level it doesn't push the woofer hard.  Indeed I could barely see it moving unlike some other speakers I have tested where the woofer cone seems to want to jettison out.  Perhaps room enforcement is helping.  It is certainly a deviation from ""ideal measurement"" that seems to work.I should note that I was not entirely happy with the sound of female vocals at the end but with playing more with EQ you could get there possibly.Regardless, I sat there and listened to track after track and did not want to stop.  Whoever says you need two speakers to enjoy music is clearly wrong.  With the right speaker response, a single one can sound really good.ConclusionsThe Parts Express DIY C-Note kit doesn't have an ideal response but seemingly what it has is very good.  It can play loud in a pleasant manner with good detail and solid bass.  I have tested other budge speakers but they don't play this loud and this well.If can handle a bit of gluing and finishing, you can have a very good sounding budget speaker here. I am going to put the C-Note on my recommended list of budget speakers.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I bought a ton of chicken to feed the panthers during the pandemic.

It is on kind loan from a local member.  They cost US $1,200 but I see them discounted to $1,050. The industrial design of the XT6 is unique with downfiring port that is integrated into the base:I like it!While I did not mess with it, I think the angle is adjustable.This is of course a coaxial design with the tweeter integrated into the center of the ""woofer."" Terminals were high quality and easy to turn.Speaker is designed in UK but manufactured in China.  So yes, our scrutiny of UK designed speakers continues.  Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Focusing on the all important on-axis (direct path from tweeter to your ear) we see a couple of significant dips and rising amplitude above 3 kHz neither one of which is good.On the positive front, directivity -- how close on-axis sound matches what reflects from other surfaces -- is very good with exception of one glitch around 2.5 kHz.Because of the above, our important early reflections pretty much mirror the on-axis response:Putting the two together we get our predicted in-room response:This says  you are going to have a somewhat bright sound and with some parts of your music permanently EQed down.  The dip in upper bass is most problematic as it is going to take away some ""warmth"" and detail in bass frequencies.  The exaggeration in upper registers may tend to be good in the short term but not so good in longer term.The jaggies at the end visually are bad but I suspect they are two narrow relative to our auditory bandwidth to be audible as such.Beam width horizontally is not that wide so suggest toeing in the speaker toward your ear more or less:Within that +-50 degree window you will have even response though which is good.Here is the same view in our 3-D map:We see a nice beam in red but also sections taken out.  Former is good, latter not so much.Vertically the coaxial design comes through showing much better response than typical 2-way speaker:So maybe if you have bare floors and ceiling that is close, this works better than non-coaxial design, all else being equal (which they definitely are not).Impedance and waterfall show some resonances that should not be there:Speaker Distortion Deep-dive:Avid readers of my speaker reviews know that I am increasingly suspecting distortion plays a role at least in my listening impressions.  Research says they play a distant role to tonality which I agree with.  But once you have tonality, then I think distortion matters.  That is the theory anyway.To that end, I thought I significantly ratchet up our distortion measurements.  Alas, doing so with Klippel NFS is hard.  Most distortion measurement features in that system are optional and cost significant money.  In addition, they seem to be tailored toward driver measurements than speaker (e.g. wanting me to monitor voice coil temps and such which is not practical in a speaker).  Finally, usability is not great because all measurements are optimized for frequency response with asynchronous system (play a full sweep and then analyze).I am spoiled with my Audio Precision APx555 analyzer which makes such analysis trivial.  So I finally broke down and started to use the AP analyzer for speaker testing.  But we are getting ahead of ourselves.  Let's review our still useful Klippel distortion measurements:Wow, this speaker wants to produce distortion!  Even at 86 dBSPL at 1 meter, it has that peak around 550 Hz and too high of distortion for the rest of the spectrum.Once we go up to 96 dB, hell breaks loose and we have massive peaks now (right).  We are talking 4 to 5% distortion where our hearing is sensitive.No wonder then that the XT 6 easily exceeds my criteria of 50 dB while playing at 96 dB SPL:I spent a few days developing more tests in Audio Precision.  Work is on-going.  Setup is indoor where I actually take pictures of the speakers.  Acoustics of the space can impact the measurements naturally but I have worked to minimize them.  Feedback is welcome from happy members on this.  Grumpy ones please find something else to do.Let's start simple with linearity test. This is what you are used to in my DAC tests.  Since I do not want to go deaf, and there is plenty of noise in my room, the range is quite a bit more limited than when testing electronics.  Still, it shows nicely when the speaker reaches its playback limit:The horizontal scale is calibrated to 96 dBSPL at 1 meter.  Our knee in the curve for XT6 is at +16 dB.  Adding that to 96 we get a playback level of 112 dB SPL at 1 meter.  Yes, I was wearing an ear plug.  My wife was not though and complained to be literally getting sick (after I ran the test 20 times to get it all adjusted  ). I hope to build a table for this over time so we can easily track and compare one speaker to another.  For now, you can see that the Revel M106 giving up 2 dB earlier at 110 dB SPL.There is some linear compression in both speakers to the tune of 0.5 dB.  It will be interesting to see if this repeats with other speakers.Let's examine the distortion profile starting with a rather quiet 86 dBSPL at 1 meter:Our reference Revel M106 clearly has much lower distortion, a difference that it shows much more clearly when we go to the other extreme at 106 dB:Interesting spikes in distortion in XT 6 around 2.1 kHz or so.  It only develops at this high output level:Something bad is happening around there so perhaps our linearity test is overestimating how clean the speaker can play (linearity is only at 200 Hz).There has been a lot of requests for intermodulation tests.  Alas, AP's IMD tests are designed for electronics and as such, won't allow me to dial down too low of a frequency for the second tone.  With default of say, 7 kHz for the upper tone and 60 Hz for the lower, each would be played from a different driver and not show proper intermodulation results. There is a special test called ""MOD"" where this restriction is less severe.  I was able to play dual tones within the range of the woofer but which tones to use?  I picked 85 and 655 Hz:We see quite a gap here between Revel M106 and Tannoy XT 6.  I will have to test a lot more speakers to build confidence in this test and dial the frequencies better.Finally the test I really liked to run was the spectrum analysis.  Here it is for 100 Hz tone:So quite a lot of harmonics.  Conventional wisdom says low frequency distortion is not audible.  Is it?  Let's overlay threshold of hearing on that:Naturally harmonics of the 100 Hz extend well into our hearing range where our ears are lot more sensitive.  We see that the bars easily exceed the threshold of hearing so they are going to mix with musical detail at low levels and obscure them.We need to look at masking as well so this is not a complete analysis but there is some smoke here.  I have a lot more measurements but am going to stop here until I develop them more.Speaker Listening TestsI looked at the measurements first before listening and expected ""bad sound"" but such was not the case during my first ""5 second"" impression.  What I was hearing was light to be sure -- indicative of the high frequency emphasis.  Audibility was not nearly as bad as I expected however. I filled in the gaps and knocked down the highs and that definitely helped.  But given the theme of this review -- focus on distortion -- I went another way.  I still took the highs down.  And put in the usual high pass filter to get rid of the most extreme distortions.  Latter did the trick as before, nicely improving detail in higher spectrum with no effect on amount of bass.  I then added to very sharp notches at dominant distortion points:Due to our auditory bandwidth being much higher, neither notch filter changed tonality.  It did however clean up the notes, getting rid of grunginess and lack of clarity in them.   Granted, same thing can happen if you just imagine it so.    But I think they are helping and would be something to experiment with.Before and after made a significant difference, making the speaker less bright and cleaner.  Ideal solution would call for additional filters to fill in the gaps.ConclusionsThe Tannoy Revolution XT 6 brings distinct looks to a crowded market which I liked.  Objectively though, the coaxial design brought with it a choppy and uneven frequency response which research and my experience shows to not be good.  Fortunately the audible effect is not severe.  What is severe is level of measured distortion.   This distortion in my opinion is audible and serves to produce a distorted sound.  Fortunately careful EQ seems to deal with them but then wind up with so many patches to get the speaker to sound right.  The designer should have done this, not us.So overall, I can't recommend the Tannoy XT 6.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Yet again I am posting a review way past lunch time and when my sugar reservoir has emptied.

Yes, you read that right.  It is a 3-way speaker with a mid-range driver in a space where 99% of speakers are 2-way.  I purchased it from Amazon for US $149.  Bad for me but for those of you shopping for bargains, the SS-CS5 cost just US $78 including shipping for a pair!!! I can't sell you my used socks for that price and still come out whole.Note: I used to work for Sony and our company Madrona Digital is a dealer for Sony so read as much bias as you want into this review.While rather light, the SS-CS5 doesn't look particularly cheap or bad:Here is the back side:Is that Cyrillic translation I see for the word ""manufactured?"" Speaker is made in Malaysia so why Russian language translation for that one word?Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Worried that the soundfiled would be complex due to 3-way design, I upped the number of measurement points to above 800 but that still was not enough to fully capture the energy above 14 kHz.  So what you see in the measurements below, underestimates the highest audible region by a few dBs.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We see fair bit of frequency response anomolifes identified by broad peaks and dips which should make them quite audible.  We also have heightened energy starting around 8 kHz even though what is seen as noted is actually lower than reality. We see resonances as indicated by the same blips in all three upper graphs around 1 kHz, and 2+ kHz. There is also directivity error around 3 kHz so I imagine that is one of the crossover points (can't find the spec).Room reflections are also uneven:Putting it all together, this is what we can predict for a hypothetical average listening room:It is more or less what we could have predicted from the on-axis response in the first graph.  Overall, the response is not going to be balanced.Horizontal directivity is not smooth and varies with the driver in play:The tweeter ""beams"" (narrows its response) quite a bit compared to mid-range it seems.Vertical response is hardly ever good in 2-way speakers.  Here it seems more of a mess:Notice how the tweeter response at 20 kHz is so spread out with dips and peaks.Impedance graph shows some kinks which usually indicates resonances:Here is our waterfall which can also indicate resonances and such:Being a small speaker, I started the distortion measurements with 86 dB SPL at one meter:We expect and get some distortion in low frequencies.  But also get a peak around 5 kHz.  This becomes much more clear when we look at the distortion percentages at both 86 and 96 dB SPL:Hard to fault such a small and cheap speaker but still, expect a lot of distortion across the board especially if you turn it up.Speaker Listening TestsI always look forward to the first few seconds after the speaker plays.  Here, I was like ""maybe this is not so bad"" until another five seconds passed and I said, ""man this thing is bright!"" It is so bright that if you play music in the dark, you may have to wear sunglasses!  It is also muddy to some extent although the brightness gives the impression of detail. On the ""good news"" side I could not get the woofer to bottom out.  This is because it doesn't produce a ton of bass but importantly, it gets so bright and loud in upper registers that you want to turn it down.So I reached into my audio toolbox of filters in Roon player to see if I can improve the sound. This is what I wound up with:The first filter as show, worked very well, improving detail level and overall balance.  But the sound was still quite bright. So I put in a quick and dirty shelving filter for the high frequencies.  That tames some of the problems there but still, this is not a listenable speaker for me.  It would require a lot more work to possibly make it not sound so bright.For a quick test, I put my hand on the little tweeter and that gave much needed relief!  If it were me, I would just disconnect the tweeter as a quick fix.  My overall sanity would be in danger otherwise.ConclusionsBoy, did I go into this review hoping for a great bargain at this price.  Around $36 a speaker.  Are you kidding me?  Alas, that was not meant to be.  I don't know what the objective scores are but subjective results are just too annoying for me to tolerate.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Sony SS-CS5 speaker.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The pink panthers are getting restless and the males say they want to see some virtual ""action"" since they can't get it outdoor.

It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me and costs US $1,500 for a pair.The LS50 Meta comes in different colors and I must say, it looks stunning in white:You could sell it as a decoration piece and it would still sell strongly!Even the back panel oozes beauty and custom design:Love the wide apart binding posts that are easy to tighten and loosen.Speaker also feels quite dense and solid which is good.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of about 1%. Clear high frequency response is responsible for ease of measurement in this regard.Reference axis is approximately the center of the tweeter.KEF LS50 Meta MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Ah, close to perfection.  The only issue is the roughness in the crossover region with some hills and valleys.  Directivity which is a metric of how close off-axis sounds are to direct on-axis (what hits your ears first), is very good as well.The above is substantially better than older LS50 which had an uneven frequency response.Sensitivity is low at around 83 dB or so.With both drivers co-located, I could not separate their response but could provide the port/cabinet contributions:I can't figure out that bump around 1.5 to 2 kHz.  Could be resonance from the woofer that we can't see.Back to our spin measurements, here are the off-axis responses:Put that together with on-axis and we get one well behaved speaker:We can see the well managed directivity control better in beam width and horizontal directivity:The price you pay for this is slightly narrow directivity of ± 50 degrees instead of the usual ±60 degrees.  So I suggest pointing the speaker at you.Vertically the coaxial driver cleans the clocks of any standard 2-way speaker:So not very critical if you sit at the level of the tweeter or not.Looking at the mid frequency 3-D directivity balloon, we see the best response since I started showing it (which hasn't been long as of this writing):The globes are not very deformed and nicely project energy forward.Company touts lower distortion for this speaker versus the old KEF LS50.  Let's look at that:Looks like distortion in from 200 Hz and up is excellent but down low, even at 86 dBSPL, we hit 100% THD.  Unfortunately I don't have comparable measurements for LS50 as that was a long time ago before I standardized this way.Impedance is quite low at 3.7 ohm and stays there for good bit of the spectrum:Combined with low sensitivity, you need to have a beefy amplifier to drive them.Finally, for the fans of timing graphs, here are the impulse and waterfall responses:KEF LS50 Meta Speaker Listening TestsI always test speakers with the same set of tracks and in the same order.  Usually the first few seconds of the first track tells me most of what I need to know about the sound of the speaker and this situation was no different.  The sound was ""right"" and very nice.  For confirm I went through the rest of my test playlist and the answer stayed the same.Wanting to see the effect of the dips in 1 to 3 kHz, I developed a single filter at 1189 Hz.  Getting it to fill that gap requires a Q of something like 7.  At that level, turning it on and off showed basically non-existent difference as predicted by psychoacoustics.  We just don't have that kind of discrimination in frequency in that range.  I suppose if you wanted to be anal about it, you could fill the holes.  It wouldn't make things worse and maybe the combination would make more of a difference.  For me, it wasn't worth the time.    I was happy with the speaker as is.Was it all perfect? No.  As I turned up bass heavy track, the low bass notes change their tonality and quickly become distorted.  Notch the volume even higher and you are greeted with scary crackle.  You can visually see this in the driver.  It separates from the tweeter which is kind of disconcerting but that is how the coaxial driver works.  By the time you see any significant separation/movement of the woofer, the bass starts to change.  Push it to move more and you are in distortion territory.  The driver is simply too small/lacks the excursion for high dynamic range.That said, I had no trouble getting usable volume out of one speaker.  With two speakers, it would be plenty for most people.  Problem is, I am not most people.    I don't want to know limits of equipment I use.ConclusionsKEF moves the bar it set with the LS50 with the Meta revision.  I was not a fan of the original but they have won me over with near perfect measurements and listening test results.  Make this speaker handle more dynamics in bass and I would kiss the ground it walks on.  But that is not there so a notch lower for me.  But really, this is an excellent speaker.  No doubt about that.I am happy to recommend the KEF LS50 Meta.  Suggest pairing it with a subwoofer if you want to play loud bass though.Edit: video review posted as well:----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a local member.  They cost US $749 for a pair.  That may seem high for a bookshelf speaker but you are getting two speakers in one.  An up firing two-way coaxial driver that is driven by its own terminals.  And a front facing 3-way speaker with the same coaxial driver mated with a small ""woofer.""Here is what it looks like:These are introduced back in 2014 and Dolby Atmos was all the rage (news, not delivery).  Realizing getting people to stick speakers in their ceiling is hard, Dolby announced this upfiring scheme at the same time as the surround sound technology.  They proceed to license a fancy crossover for it which cost a lot.  I don't know if that is what is used here or not.Overall, the speaker feels quite a bit more hefty substantial than the pioneer SP-BS22-LR Andrew Jones design I tested earlier.

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 2.7 Hz. Over 600  measurement points were used to assure high precision in higher frequencies.  For the first time, I am also using averaging to lower noise in bass frequencies.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Well, we do have flaws.  Disappointing to see that wide dip between 3 and 10 kHz.  Good thing is that the early reflections more or less follow the same dip so EQ would be useful to fill that hole. Sensitivity is specified I think at 86 dB which within the vague way that is measured, is OK.  But if you look at the bass frequencies, you easily drop to 80 dB and lower.  So as is typical of these little bookshelf speakers, they need more than a little amplifier to drive them. Predictive in-room response is similar to on-axis so problem remains:As noted, what comes directly at you and what goes to the sides are similar in both vertical and horizontal axis (due to use of coaxial driver):Impedance measurement shows a dip to below 4 ohm so again, you need to have good amplification that can handle such low impedances:Driving the speaker with 10 volts (above are at 2.83 volts) shows a number of distortion sources correlating with the crossover frequency:This indicates the driver has too low of a break up point, or it is used above its comfort factor.Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsSpeaker Listening TestsI started my listening tests with a single filter for the prominent room mode.  The sound was OK but somewhat dull.  So I dialed in a boost to fix the lower treble region and a dip for the final hump (yellow and purple dots):In short-term listening, this made a substantial difference.  So much more brilliance and detail came to the forefront.  Maybe a bit too much though if you listen for a long time so more precise adjustment and testing should be done to run with them.   Still, the EQ I felt worked well here.  I could enjoy my reference tracks. Bass however was absent.  There is just no deep bass here so overall tonality was light.For kicks, I also played with the upfiring Atoms speaker.  It sounded ""interesting"" and better than I thought it would.  Despite using a single speaker, the special effects were remarkable in hearing sounds at times a few feet to the right of the speaker and such.ConclusionsThe hole in frequency response and high distortion around the crossover point rule out this speaker for any kind of hifi use, certainly at these prices.  If you have it, then some amount of EQ fixes what is most broken here.  A lot of the budget has gone into that up firing Atmos driver and crossover than goodness in the front part of the speaker.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Pioneer SP-EBS73-LR. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Running way behind in my garden planting.

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was enough to compute the sound field of the speaker within 1% error.Temperature was 78 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Was not sure what to use for measurement axis given the offset tweeter.  I decided to place it slightly to the left of the tweeter center.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Gosh, this is close to being good had we not had the sharp jaggies around 600 Hz.  The disturbance is narrow in nature so maybe not too audible.Early window reflections show the same indicating it is not simple diffraction:Predicted in-room response shows what we already know:There is a slight rise in energy in lower treble region that would lead to a bit of brightness.  And whatever that peak does around 600 Hz.The peak appears in the woofer response but could be due to the passive radiator which I did not measure due to its location:Impedance dips to 4 ohm which is typical of these small speakers:Radiation in horizontal axis is not flat which is a bit of concern:Here is the same in the form of a heatmap:Notice how we have more energy on the right than on the left due to tweeter being offset.  If we made that the upper range of woofer would be out of alignment.Here it is vertically:Speaker Distortion MeasurementsPlaying a sweep at both 86 and 96 dB SPL @ 1 meter shows that the woofer is not happy at either level:There was a horrendous rattle/noise at very low frequencies as you see below:So best not feed it ultra low bass.Finally CSD/waterfall:Speaker Subjective Listening TestI listened to the D11 without seeing the measurements.  First impression was positive.  My reference tracks translated well and provided good ""audiophile"" enjoyment as they should.  After a few minutes, I noticed a bit of brightness in female ""s"" sounds.  And a bit of unhappiness in upper bass region in my brain.I then looked at the measurements and attempted to fix these.  Putting a notch at 618 Hz even with ""high q"" (narrow) filter caused bass to be lost which subjective is not a good trade off.  I think the problem is that we have a dip right before this region with poor directivity to boot so EQ is not as simple as it seems.I added very low Q (1) dip centered around 6 kHz and I thought that made a positive change in shaving the highs some.  But it turned out to be more of a taste thing so I am not showing it.At this point, I turned off the EQ and played music for a while and sound was enjoyable.  With exception of tracks with deep bass which caused static in the woofer, the D11 could play quite loud without bottoming out.  Its deep cabinet is helping in this regard.ConclusionsThe cabinet construction and finish is definitely a step above budget speakers.  The look of the drivers is gimmicky but maybe you can put the grill on to hide it which may also lower the highs and make them acceptable.  Subjectively the D11 sound was almost right.  So while not a perfect speaker, I generally liked the Definitive Demand D11 and am putting it on my recommended list.

Alas, that is not what we have.  There is a dip in likely crossover region followed with elevated energy at treble frequencies.  The company advertising says as much:More on my listening impressions later.  For now, this is our predicted in-room response:And important early reflections:Typical of non-coaxial 2-way speakers, vertical response is not good so advise thick carpeting at least.Horizontal and vertical directivity is as expected:A few degrees above the tweeter axis seems to improve the response so you may want to get less tall stand that puts the tweeter a bit below your ear level:Impedance graph shows higher than normal impedance which is easier on amplifier:Distortion graph shows something going a bit wrong around 400 Hz:Otherwise mid to high frequency distortion is quite low which bodes well for that elevated response.And finally our waterfall:Speaker Listening TestsI had my son who is in his twenties with me for this part of the test.  Without showing him the measurements I asked his impression.  He said ""metallic parts of music are exaggerated.""  That was exactly my impression.  What is there is clean mind you, but definitely stands out.  And as advertising said, bass does not stand out.  I dialed in some bass boost and that made a very positive impression but caused the woofer to bottom out at elevated playback volume.  With two speakers (my tests are with one), that may work.ConclusionsThe sound of Bambusa MG 1 seems to be as designed both objectively and subjectively.  I have a feeling that in quick listen and for a target market of aging audiophiles, elevated highs may be a good idea.  It is not what I like to live with though.  What would be nice then is a switch in the back that puts in a resistor in the path of the tweeter to dial down its energy some.

I purchased it last month.  The T15 is supposed to cost US $115 but I think I only paid US $70 for my pair.With the grill removed, the T15 looks decent:I was surprised by the quality binding posts at this price point:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections. It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room. All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed.Over 1000 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field in all but the 4 to 6 kHz where the error is about 2% Final database of measurements and data is 1.0 Gigabytes in size.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Yup.  Not pretty.  Horrific drop in upper mids/lower treble region of 3 to 6 kHz.  This is likely due to tweeter and woofer getting out of phase and causing cancellation on-axis.    We also have peaks here and there.Zooming into directivity plot shows that on and off-axis response vary a ton:So how and where you listen to these speakers matters a lot with respect to the sound you get.Computer prediction of response you get in the room is troubling of course:No matter which way you look at the performance of T15 speaker, it is going to be colored, modifying the intent of the content producer (who likely has a much more flat response speaker than these).Basic Speaker MeasurementsImpedance range is stated as 6 to 8 ohms which doesn't match reality:In low frequencies where we need power due to high spectrum of music and effects, impedance is pretty close to 4 ohm.We also have a number of kinks in the response which typically indicates resonances.  Maybe you can see them in this waterfall graph:Distortion plot has a peak around 400 Hz:When I was listening to the sweeps during the measurement, I would hear a ghost of the same sweep at a higher pitch and a bit delayed. Advanced Speaker MeasurementsFloor reflections are usually not good but in this case, the off-axis is better than on-axis so they help fill that hole some:You can see why when we look at 10 degree sweeps vertically:Usually the on-axis curve in red is the top one but it is not here.  The top and hence one with least droop is + and - 20 degrees or so.  Best not to listen to this speaker straight on.  Place it lower or higher than your ear level.There is not much help for horizontal issues:Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsThe contour graphs show what we already know:I looked at the soundfield around 4 KHz and found the proof of our problem:We see the radiation from tweeter and woofer cancelling out in the middle.  Go higher and lower and you are better.Speaker Listening TestsI set the T15 up in my near-field setup on my desk to the left.  Levels were matched against the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR on the right of my monitor.  Matching levels was a bit challenging as it was content specific due to high frequency response variation of T15.  But I tried and got it close.I expected the T15 to sound horrid but that was not the case!  Likely due to bounce from my desk, I was not hearing the ditch in the response in full glory. The pioneer was much better because it had first and foremost more bass and hence warmer sound.  Secondary, I could hear instruments recessing behind in the T15.  But overall, it just didn't sound that horrible.  Power capability seemed to actually be a bit better than the Pioneer.So yeh, a bit of quandary.ConclusionsThe Polk Audio T15 hits an incredibly low price point while producing something that doesn't look like trash.  Measured performance does show trash and good bit of it.  Normally this would be enough to get it a headless panther but post listening tests, I thought that would be too much damning so gave it one notch above.I like to encourage you to save more money and buy the Pioneer if you can.  Despite being much cheaper, I can't justify recommending the Polk T15 even though subjective performance was not horrible.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Don't make me tell you another bad joke to get you to donate money.

It was designed as a tribute to Jeff Bagby so emulates his design values.  The kit parts are a pretty reasonable $600 for a 3-way passive radiator design.  The midrange, tweeter and PR are SB Acoustics and the woofer is a Dayton ES180TiA.  I was already working with the ES180 and wanted to do a 3-way design, so was naturally interested in the Integrity.  Am planning to downsize in the next few years and a compact bookshelf with good low bass also appealed to me.The Integrity cabinet is 18” x 8.5” x 11”.  It is a fairly simple cabinet, but has a couple of challenges.  One is recessing the truncated midrange and the other is the PR cutout.  I will address the PR cutout during the build.  As for the midrange, Rick indicates that flush mounting is acceptable.  However, this unit is getting Klippel test scrutiny, so he supplied a pre-cut front baffle to me.  I was able to complete the rest of the cabinet with a piece of 2’ x 4’ x .75” MDF.  This is about as big a board as like to handle on my table saw.  The Integrity panels are sized to be foolproof.  All opposing panels are the same dimensions.  The center brace is also the same size as the top and bottom panels. See attachments for  details (added after initial thread post).To start, I took the MDF and crosscut it to 25.5” wide.  This piece can then be ripped 9.5“ wide on each side to create 2 panels.  Each of these panels can be crosscut at 18” to create the side panels.  The remaining parts are used to create the top and bottom.  They are already 9.5“ deep, so they just need to be trimmed slightly to 7” widths.   The remaining panels, can be cut from the other half of the original MDF board.  In my case, I need the back panel early, so I cut a 8.5“ x 18” section from the remaining board.  You should have enough wood remaining to cut the midrange enclosure pieces.  This is another panel just like the top, so can use it as a pattern. The midrange enclosure back is 7” x 7.125“.At this point, you should do a dry fit of the cabinet to ensure the panels are correct and fit well.  It is best to do this on a softer flat surface to avoid damaging parts if they fall over.  Use the attached side view as a guide.  NOTE: you will get the best results if the top, bottom and brace are square and sized to fit.  If the outside joints are not smooth, trimming these pieces equally will save work later and produce a better cabinet.You are now ready to start gluing.  Take one of the sides and lay it on a flat surface.  I use the top of my table saw.  TIP: before applying glue, be sure to lightly sand the mating surfaces. Applying wood glue to the inside length (18"" part) of the back panel attach to the edge of the side panel.  Clamp lightly until glue sets. It should look this..."

It was purchased new by a member and kindly drop shipped to me.  It costs US $391 on Amazon for a single unit. I must say, I was impressed by the fit and finish of the C3:The enclosure is sold and dense with a beautiful piano black finish. I love that the back panel has threaded screw holes to mount the speaker to the wall/ceiling for surround/Atmos applications:Speaker is manufactured in China.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of around 1%.It is down to freezing outside so the best I could do was raise the temperature to 56 degrees.  Speaker however was kept warm indoors prior to measurements. Reference axis was that of the tweeter.  Grills were not used.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.NHT C3 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:EDIT:  looks like the mid-range is damaged in this unit.  It has a dimple on the bottom of it.  This could explain the mid-frequency dip.  Unfortunately I only have one unit to test so can't verify.On-axis response is kind of wavy.  This was unexpected as measurements performed elsewhere are much flatter.  My in-room measurements showed the same so I don't think it is an issue with NFS measurements.  Likely a design change was made to tilt up the highs more to keep up with the competition in the showroom.  We can see the uneven response in individual driver response:Seems like one could push up the tweeter level a bit or else, bring the tweeter down.  The tweeter by itself has uneven response.As noted in the first graph directivity is good so for good or bad, early window reflections follow on-axis irregularities:Predicted in-room response shows very little tilt so speaker is going to sound bright:As I noted, directivity is good due to use of mid-range driver:If you are going to use this up high for surround applications, be sure to tilt it down some:Distortion was two completely different stories depending on level:At 86 dB, this is professional monitor level of distortion, not a budget passive speaker!  Push it though and things get bad especially with that tweeter.  I have not seen one fall apart this badly.  Fortunately that is where we have elevated response so we would want to EQ that down anyway and that should help keep that distortion in check.Needless to say, at 94 dBSPL it exceeds our threshold:Impedance is typical of these speakers, down to 4 ohm or so:I forgot to mention earlier that sensitivity is rather low, dropping to 82 to 83 dB in mid-range area.  Company advertises 87 dB which would only be true of the peaking tweeter.NHT C3 Listening Tests and EqualizationThe high frequency peaking was not obnoxious but clearly overdone (as appealing as that could be for a few seconds).  So had to EQ that anyway and while there, might as well tweak the rest:Filling that little but wide dip in upper bass was important in providing balance relative to highs (which I did not fully cure on purpose).  I then filled in the 1 to 4 kHz region and job was done.  Once there, the benefits of a sealed enclosure was there with its ability to play sub-bass without getting distorted.  Alas, without the boosted upper bass that we get from ported speakers, the bass was a bit light but I was fine with that. Dynamics was very good and speaker could handle a lot of power.  And a lot of power is what I had to feed it so don't get a 50 watt amp.  You need more than that.ConclusionsIt is a shame we didn't measure the C3 as well as others had.  That would have made it a lot closer to ideal.  As is, without EQ it is bright and hence ""detailed.""  To my ears, that gets old fast so EQ is mandatory in my book.  And so is filling in the other two dips.  Speaker takes EQ well since we are not trying to push it where distortion is highest. Overall, I was happy with the NHT C3 and would recommend it with EQ.  No without.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Overall on-axis is reasonably flat which is what we like to see.  Bass response is stepped though, being much higher above 100 Hz.  There are two problematic resonances at 700 and 1.2 kHz as noted.  Maybe we can see those in the waterfall plot:A kink in the impedance flat around 650 Hz confirms the issue there:On the good news front, directivity (now good on and off-axis response are) is quite good resulting in reflections that more or less mirror on-axis response:Putting all of this together, this is our predicted response in a typical room:Directivity plots in both horizontal and vertical are rather pretty, courtesy of that coaxial driver:Notice however that horizontal directivity is narrow in the low to me frequencies.Here is our distortion and in-room response with or without plug:I tried stuffing the plug half way and then all the way but it made next to no difference.  The plug is pretty porous and I could tell it reducing the port action but definitely doesn't plug it fully.Above was at 86 dB.  Boosting to 96 dB creates tons more distortion:Subjective Speaker Listening TestsMy first impression was ""blah"" with sound that was rudder muddy and coming from smack center of the speaker.  I first turned off my room mode EQ to give some help to 100 Hz.  That helped a bit but there were still problems.Next I attacked the two resonances with two quick filters and results were positive:That upper bass slight tubbiness required more work than I was willing to put in it.  And at any rate, would require in-situ (in-room) measurements to proper correct.With the two quick filters in place, the sound became pleasant but I could not get past the point focus of it.  The optical bias is strong here so may be in a blind test it won't stand out as much.  But I think narrow directivity from 500 to 1000 Hz may be at fault here.  For new readers, my testing is in mono (one speaker to the left).ConclusionsThere is clear engineering effort here to produce a speaker with good objective metrics.  Alas, the upper bass boost may not work for everyone and lack of control of the two resonances has a high impact on clarity and detail.  Directivity control due to coaxial driver seems to create a much more of a point source which many people think they like, but was not my cup of tea.So, reasonably good objective measurements but doesn't do it for me.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: OK, this is a very jarring response.  A woofer doesn't dance up and down so sharply by itself in a few hundred hertz?  Fortunately I measure each driver at point blank and this tells us the problem:See the port response in orange?  It peaks (resonates) so much that its response actually exceeds that of the woofer creating those two ""horns.""  It continues to mess up the woofer response even past that.Strange to see the woofer response flattening post crossover point.  Maybe it was also resonating?  Regardless, if that was pulled down more , the combined response with tweeter would have been better.Back to the spinorama, note that the efficiency to a few hundred hertz is only 80 dB or so.  Indeed, I had to boost the signal by 6 dB compared to average of what I use for most speakers to get to 86 dBSPL output.  Better have a lot of amplifier power.  Don't be fooled by the small size of this speaker.Early window response shows the same problems we see on-axis since port response is more or less omnidirectional:Combined we get what dominates the on-axis:Impedance is good bit higher than what is typical for 2-way speakers:Resonaces are visible by the way in kinks in the impedance graph (little ripples).Distortion is naturally high at levels exceeding 86 dBSPL but I was surprised the speaker did not bottom out:A highlight is the horizontal beamwidth:Because the woofer is not much larger than the tweeter, their beamwidths blend together much better than in larger configurations.Vertically is a mess as it typically is:Makes sure your ears are more or less at the height of the tweeter.Ascend Sierra Luna Speaker Listening TestsI tell you, marketing guys are right that the first impressions of a bright speaker are positive.  Such was the case during the first few seconds: ""oh listen to the details!""  This changed though after a minute or so to: ""man this is bright!""  The sound was lispy as well but not super annoying.  Just bright.  So I pulled out the EQ:Despite the aggressive shelving filters I put in for high frequencies, the outcome was still a bit too bright but much more manageable.  Fixing the two port created resonances only made a subtle difference -- certainly less than what jumps out in the frequency response graph.  A more accurate EQ may generate better outcome though than my eyeballing.On a positive front, this speaker can handle a ton of power and get quite loud!  Lack of bass response means that the little woofer does not bottom out -- not easily anyway.  I was pretty impressed by this and should make the speaker more suitable for home theater applications.ConclusionsDespite being very small, the Luna seems well built.  Alas, poor port response wreaks havoc on the bass response.  And elevated tweeter response makes the overall response too bright.  Directivity is generally good so EQ seems to work well.  Power handling is excellent due to not attempting to change the laws of physics and generate more bass than it is capable of.As a perfectionist of course I want to see near ruler flat on-axis response at these prices.  We don't have that here so score should be way down.  I am not going to absolute bottom though as I hate distortion and lack of power handling in small speakers which the Luan does not suffer from.Overall, I can't recommend the Ascend Sierra Luna but put it out there for people to optimize it with EQ to get respectable sound.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Response is generally smooth but deviations flat on-axis are quite broad. This means that more musical notes hit them and hence much more audible than ""high Q"" narrow variations.  Emphasis is from a few hundred hertz to 2 kHz and then above 8 kHz or so.Sensitivity is higher than typical reaching as high as 90 dB at some frequencies.  Given the core business of SVS is subwoofers, perhaps the design goal was for these speakers to play loud and if that means deviating from flat on-axis response, so be it.Interestingly, important early reflections add up to a smooth response:Putting the two together we get what we already saw in on-axis response analysis:We have simultaneous ""warmth"" and ""brightness"" depending on how you draw the trend line.Impedance is on the low side as it is typical of this size speaker:I did not try to optimize the waterfall display so here it is with default parameters:As it is, it shows persistent resonances at a number of frequencies.  Of course if I raise the display floor, they can be reduced or eliminated in the measurement.Driver ResponsesI put the microphone very close to the tweeter, woofer and port and recorded a full sweep:It seems that the boost in upper frequencies to midrange is due design of the crossover and possibly the resonance in the port.  The former could have been designed out so one has to assume it is intentional.  Here is the crossover:EDIT: looks like above is for their tower speakers, not bookshelf that I tested.Lots and lots of parts in there although all inductors are iron core making me wonder if they will saturate.Speaker Radiation PatternLet's analyze how the sound radiates horizontally relative to tweeter axis:Focusing on the red line, ideally that would be horizontal and not have the ups and downs.  The woofer is getting directional as we approach the 2 kHz frequency whereas the tweeter is at the other extreme, with wider directivity so we have a discontinuity.  Beamwidth widens, then narrows, then widens again.  Not a good thing in general.This is less revealing in our heatmap graph of the same:And here is our vertical performance which is less critical than horizontal:Speaker Distortion AnalysisLet's start with Klippel system distortion measurement at 86 dB and 96 dB SPL @ 1 meter:My threshold is 0.5% at 96 dB SPL and the SVS Ultra more or less meets that above 100 Hz which is good.  Here it is at an absolute level:Switching to Audio Precision with our deep dive into distortion we have the following results (these tests are being refined):Dynamic amplitude compression is very gradual and never falls off the cliff:This should let the speaker play quite loud without bottoming out as small speakers typically do.Distortion at 100 Hz tone is reasonable which we could tell from previous Klippel measurements:Sweeping the full audible band at five different levels we get:I am not trusting the above graph much as it seems to show distortion his higher than lower levels???  I did have to re-calibrate my system so maybe something went wrong there.Here is our 32-tone test simulating ""music"" at two playback levels:Distortion sadly increases where our hearing is most sensitive (2 to 5 kHz).Here is IMD distortion versus level:Subjective Listening TestsMy instant reaction to the sound of SVS Ultra was that it sounded ""warm.""  The upper bass frequencies that exaggerated give an immediate pleasant impression.  Alas, that quickly went away and while I could hear the appeal of it, it caused everything I played to have the same characteristic which was not right.  At the same time, female vocals had very sharp extensions that were almost painful to listen to.  This would come and go of course as the singing went along.I played with EQ but after a while I gave up.  Strangely no matter what I did, I could not get rid of the brightness in vocals.  I did bring down the upper bass and lower mid-range level and that mostly helped but then it exaggerated the highs.On positive front, the SVS Ultra can play really loud with good bass capability.  I could get it to start to bottom out but that was at every high playback levels.ConclusionsHaving looked at the measurements first before listening, I thought they would either sound good ""out of the box"" or do so with just a bit of EQ.  That did not happen.  Try as I did, I could not like the sound with or without EQ.  Yes, I could see the appeal of boosted upper bass in giving ""warmth"" to the speaker.  But too much of that was well, too much of a good thing.  I am puzzled where the sharpness was coming from seeing how I could not tame it.  Perhaps directivity error was causing this.I can't recommend a speaker that doesn't sound good to me and that is where I stand with SVS Ultra.  I suspect measurement score will be good, making me look bad.  So be it!  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.We have a ton of harvest from our garden.

Back panel has combined the small port with binding posts which should reduce manufacturing cost:I was surprised that the model marking and such was under the unit.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of roughly 1%.Reference axis for measurements was the center of the tweeter.  Grill was taken off.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.PSB Alpha P3 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:I must say, I was very disappointed to see so many issues in the on-axis response.  It is uneven and suffers from a number of 'acoustic events.'  We can easily see their  causes if we measure each driver and port in near-field:The port and woofer resonances are so loud that they push through the overall response.   When running the sweeps for distortion tests, i could easily hear a ""zing"" as it went on at a distinct frequency.In addition, this is a very low sensitivity speaker.  I had to push the levels to the highest I have tested to get 86 dBSPL out of the speaker.  It was 5 to 6 dB more than average.Directivity is decent for good and bad in the way it creates similar room sound but also with the same faults as on-axis:Resulting in this predicted in-room response:There is a clear bass hump as well but depending on the room and your taste, that may be OK.Distortion graphs show one of the resonances very clearly:It is a small speaker so can't be expected to do well at 96 dBSPL.Beamwidth is reasonably good:Resulting in the same in horizontal directivity:Vertical is typical of 2-way speakers so point the tweeter at your ears if you can:Finally, impedance measurement again shows same resonance:But also low impedance which when combined with low sensitivity, means that you need a very stout amplifier to drive these speakers despite their size.PSB Alpha P3 Listening TestsThe first impression was not bad and didn't match what the graphs were indicating. Then I realized my ears are heavily plugged up from working in the yard recently so popped them open and realized the harshness of the highs.  And a resonance coming through with female vocals just like what I had heard in measurements.At first, I thought the problem was 1 to 2 kHz.  Filtering that out helped but not as much as I thought.  I messed with a bunch of stuff until I went after the 3 to 4 kHz one and that made the highs much better:Notice how I actually increased levels across the board to make the subjective loudness the same.  Whenever you filter out different bands you reduce overall volume so it is very important to compensate for that.  Otherwise the EQ may sound worse in quick AB testing even though it is doing the right thing.The dip at 150 Hz is optional.  Depending on your room modes, this may or may not be necessary.  I went back and forth on it as some tracks sounded better with it or the other way around.When it was all done, the highs were more pleasing but still not quite right.As noted in the measurements, I had to really crank up my amplifier to drive these.  On one hand they took power well for how little they are.  On the other hand, the bass becomes distorted tubby sounding.ConclusionsI have high expectations from PSB given company/designer's work at NRC and with Dr. Floyd Toole.  Alas, none of that was delivered here with response that is very uneven with many indications of the problem areas.  I appreciate that they are trying to keep the size and cost down but at the same time, I have a minimum bar of fidelity I like to see and the P3 misses that by fair margin.Given the fact that my ears are plugged up, I am going to put most emphasis on objective measurements and say that I can't recommend the PSB Alpha P3.  Company knows how to do better and needs to do that even in budget class.  Competition is strong here with many good options.NOTE: there is a poll on top where you can rate this speaker as well.  You don't have to be an owner to do so.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

They were purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  The HDI-1600 costs US $900 for one. Note: my company Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman products such as JBL line (although we hardly sell any audio gear of this type).  And I am personally friends with key people in the company.  So feel free to read as much bias as you like in this review.There is some style to the HDI-1600 but overuse of plastic degrades the image of having bought anything expensive:Back panel binding posts are OK but the bi-wire shunt is thin and flimsy (does the job though):Product is made in China.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are referenced to the tweeter axis with frequency resolution of 2.7 Hz.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:That is one flat response from about 700 Hz to 9,000 Hz.  There is a peak in bass which I actually prefer in past listening tests.  The dip above 10 KHz looks bad but perceptually won't be that significant due to its high frequency.The on and off-axis sounds are very similar to each other as indicated by the blue dashed line being rather smooth.  This means the speaker is room friendly as reflections sound similar to direct sound of the speaker.  And gives you flexibility to position the speaker angle as you like.There is strong peaking near 20 kHz but most of us don't hear that far so I don't think it is an issue.Predicted response in a simulated room shows what I just described:Due to good summation of early reflections:So don't go chasing myths on the Internet to absorb reflections. Horizontal directivity (how well the sound drops off from on-axis) resembles very good studio monitors:Vertically is chewed up as is typical of many 2-way speakers:Due to increased dip around crossover frequency (1.9 kHz) as you go below the tweeter, don't put the speaker on too high of a stand.  Not a huge deal though.Impedance response shows the typical dip below 4 ohm which nearly matches the honest specification from JBL of 4 ohm:Speaker Distortion MeasurementsSince I started to test speakers there has been a lot of complaints about them.  So I decided to spend some time on them to refine the measurements.  This added a ton of time to this review so hopefully it is worth it.  Two key changes are made:1. Speaker is driven at a calibrated level of 96 dB at 1 meter.  This matches what soundstage uses.  My measurements are actually at 1/3 of meter and then calibration compensated for 1 meter.  This sharply reduces the effect of noise in the room at the potential expense of higher distortion from the microphone.  Soundstage goes the other way around, measuring at 2 meters (at 90 dB which is the same as 96 dB at 1 meter).2. I use the fancy processing in Klippel NFS to dial out the room effect.  This makes the display smoother but gets rid of all the room modes especially in low frequencies.  For some reason it boosted the distortion level a bit in mid frequencies which I am still investigating.3. I worked on making the colors more visible (I have a very small selection of what I can choose from).For this speaker, it required 11 volts input to get to 96 dB at 1 meter so pretty close to 10 volts I used to use.  Here are the results:We definitely have rising distortion at crossover frequency which could be the woofer/port at the tail end of its response, or a tweeter being asked to go too low.  The range that is covered by higher distortion is middle of the road so definitely will be hit on with typical content.  It is almost all second harmonic so masking will be more effective on them.Waterfall PlotI spent good bit of time on this also, using NFS filtering to dial out the room.  Knowing what I was looking for, I managed to get a graph that showed the issues we already know:We see a resonance at 700 Hz which we had seen in the spinorama.  And messiness around crossover frequency we saw in distortion measurements.High Frequency Dip InvestigationWe have seen that dip before in Kali speakers which the designer mentioned was due to waveguide diffraction.  So I dug in with 3-D visualization to see if it is the same issue:Left side is with the tweeter producing 5 kHz and we generally see one large projection from it (speaker is pointed at you with ""nref"" being tweeter center).  When we go above 10 kHz however, the highest amplitude sound source is on the two sides.  They mix together and due to phase difference the middle cancels out some.  So it appears to be a diffraction issue but working backward to find problems like this from the visualization can be tricky.Speaker Listening TestsII put the JBL HDI-1600 on my typical test stand in my listening room with a single parametric EQ to dial out a room mode as I do with all other speakers (verified in this instance to definitely make a positive contribution).  The sound from the JBL HDI-1600 in a word is stunning!  That extra bass and very good power handling gives full satisfaction.  The flat mid-frequencies means all the detail is presented as it should making for a delightful contrast with that bass response.I put in a little filter to boost where the dip is.  It made a tiny difference, providing just a hair more brightness and sparkle.  I was OK with or without it.The sound was so good I sat there listening to track after track.  Sans nasty room modes, this is a speaker that is designed to give you the ""target room response"" without having to use a room EQ to get there.With 1000 watts on tap and just a single speaker playing, I finally managed to get it to cry uncle and bottom out but that was quite loud.  Funny thing, it produced so much bass that combined with its smooth plastic base, it slid back 1 inch on my metal stand!I will test it later in near-field and see how it performs there.ConclusionsThe objective performance seems to at first blush paint a picture of very good but imperfect response.  Closer look, confirmed with listening tests shows that such things as a boosted bass are likely designed in.  Listening tests confirm one of the most delightful experiences I have had in small speakers.  Price is high of course so you have to decide if that extra bit of performance is worth it to you.Needless to say, I am going to put the JBL HDI-1600 on my recommended list.  Can't wait to test the larger ones in the line.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Have to drive 120 miles roundtrip tomorrow to return a couple of speakers.

It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $700 through their various dealers. The 607 S2 comes in different color.  My same was in black:Disappointing to see no attempt at directivity control with a waveguide.  The corners are pretty sharp which at this price point, would have expected to have had some rounding over.  Back panel binding posts surprisingly are not gold plated which is the norm in this era:I love the masculine and nicely textured port.  Cleverly it is molded and tooled with the binding post, helping save cost in manufacturing and assembly (which is in China).I only found two reviews of this speakers, one from WhatHifi in UK which gave it perfect score of 5 out of 5.  And one by Steve Guttenberg which gave it speaker of the year award for 2020.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate below 1% for most of the except around 2 kHz where it crept up to 2% error.  Sound field got quite complex there suggesting multiple sources than just the two drivers (diffraction, etc.).Testing temperature was around 60 degrees F.Reference axis for measurements was the center of the tweeter.  Grill was not used in either measurements or listening tests.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:And flaws we have!  Hard to know where to start.  We can go from right to left with that peaking tweeter response to give that ""showroom zing.""  This is then followed by a dip in 2 to 3 kHz, courtesy of poor crossover design.  This then goes into peaking and some resonances around 1 to 1.7 kHz and again around 200 to 400 Hz.Bass and mid-range level is around 83 dB which is very low efficiency.  Thankfully the company is honest and rates the speaker at 84 dB efficiency.  You better have lots of amplification power to drive this speaker. Early window reflections don't paint a pretty picture either:So combined we have the problems we could predict:Near-field measurements of the drivers confirm some of the problems we have seen:Impedance graph shows a resonance and reasonable impedance:CSD/waterfall response shows more of these resonances:Horizontal beam width is rather uneven as is directivity:Vertical directivity shows a hole in response so best to stay slightly above tweeter axis:It is not all bad news.  Tweeter distortion is quite low as is the woofer if levels are kept reasonable:Company marketing video talks a lot about advanced 3-D modeling and reduction of aberrations in both drivers.  Seems like they got there on the tweeter and almost so with woofer until it breaks up.B&W 607 S2 Anniversary Edition Listening TestsFirst impressions are of elevated highs but they are extremely clean in nature as predicted by the low distortion level.  As such, they don't rip your face off as some other speakers with such treble elevation do.  Alas, you quickly realize that the bass response is just not there and all you hear is that elevated highs.  There is also slight tubbiness that comes from resonances in lower mid-range upper bass. I brought out the equalization panel in my Roon player and tried to make quick corrections.  Alas, much more help was needed before what I considered to be ""reasonable"" tonality and sound:While I am usually good at eyeballing the EQ values, way too many were needed here than what I could do.  So I suspect a more mechanically generated EQ would do better.ConclusionsVideo marketing material only talks about improvements in drivers.  That, seems to be there.  Alas, decades of research into what makes a good sounding speaker was ignored with poor integration of drivers, multiple resonances and poor directivity which result in ""proper showroom"" sound but nothing you would want to live with.  I don't mind throwing a filter or two at a speaker to make it sound good.  But this design needs way more than that.  You have to become a speaker designer, doing the work that the company was supposed to do.  And that ain't right.I can see how some subjectivist reviewer would fall in love with the clean and low distortion highs and call it an audiophile experience with micro detail, imagine and usual buzzwords.  But that is not a good diet for an audiophile. You want a speaker that gets out of the way and reproduces what is in your source faithfully.Just to make sure I was not in a ""bad audio mood,"" I swapped the 607 S2 for a Revel M105.  Wow, what an improvement in overall tonality, feel of the speaker and quality all around.  Yes, it costs twice as much.   But it shows you what proper sound is like.  It does justice to your music whereas the 607 S2 doesn't.  It latter spits on your music and says, I am going to tell you how it should sound.Is the 607 S2 the worse speaker I have heard?  No.  There is some good engineering in the driver.  I hope some of that rubs off to whoever did the system design of the speaker.The marketing material said they have sold one or two million 600 series speakers since inception.  So I suspect the management if it sees this review is going to be flippant and continue to ship subpar speakers to their customers.  It is a bit depressing that what sells is dominant factor in speaker business and design. Needless to say, I can't recommend the  B&W 607 S2 Anniversary Edition.  There are plenty of speakers at low prices that do better.Edit: video review posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...07-s2-anniversary-edition-review-video.21608/------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I purchased it a couple of months ago from Amazon.  Cost is US $349 there including Prime shipping.  If you are not familiar with PSB, those are initials of Paul Barton.  Paul worked under/with Dr. Folyd Toole while at Canadian NRC so calls from same set of research as Harman folks.  The speaker in question won streophile product of the year award in 2019. It is hard to stand out in the crowded market of budget 2-way speakers but PSB makes an attempt with upside down configuration (tweeter on the bottom) and slick magnetic grill (not shown):Back panel is ordinary sans a screw for rear mount (which then makes you wonder about the rear port):Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was not quiet enough to compute the sound field of the speaker within 1% (it slipped to a bit more than that in higher frequencies but still not significant). Measurement axis is the tweeter center.Temperature was 80 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Oh no!  This can't be right.  On-axis response is quite uneven and directivity error very apparent -- against two of the key findings of Dr. Toole while at NRC and later at Harman.  Fortunately we have stereophile magazine review of the same:The black curve is basically what we have.  The resolution of stereophile graphs are very low so is not as clear as my measurements but otherwise, it is very close.What a shame.Going along, naturally off-axis response is poor as well:Usually I say put a rug on the floor but here, the dip in vertical direction is helping pull that bump from on-axis response.Putting the two together we get a mystery:A number of you have advocated to only post measurements in these reviews.  This is for you: what does this say about the sound you get in your room?  I bet you can't tell other than bass boost.  There is just so much wrong with that response.  Digging into what may be going on with close in measurements of each component in the speaker we get:Look at what is coming out of the rear port (orange).  That peak is so high that it pushes the on-axis response up with it. Impedance graph points to some of the same resonances:As does the waterfall graph: (anechoic)Speaker Distortion MeasurementsAs usual, we start with the distortion measurements using our Klippel KA3 analyzer at 86 and 96 dB SPL @ 1 meter to see trends:[head hits the table.]  What we see at 86 dB SPL is what I expect to see at 96 dB SPL!  This woofer/port are going nuts.  Here is the same at absolute level (anechoic as above):You better like all your bass and midrange with good bit of distortion!Switching audio analyzers, we get this for 32-tone resembling ""music:""There is so much distortion that made me spell ""up to"" wrong.  Here is our amplitude compression test:Speaker Directivity MeasurementsHere is our beamwidth in horizontal axis (ideal response would be all horizontal lines):We get the typical ± 50 degree beamwidth.  The width becomes wider in crossover region due to mismatch between woofer's beam width and tweeter's (3 kHz).In 3-D we see:And vertically:Good thing the tweeter is at the bottom because you want to keep your ears at a positive angle to it.Subjective Listening TestsFirst 5 second impression was: ""oh, there is bass there.""  Not deep bass mind you, but bass impression.  From then on, I am kind of lost for words to describe the tonality.  Female vocals sounded too warm and did not have their delicate higher pitch sound.  Male vocals were somehow a bit lost in the music.  OK, I am making stuff up now.  I went into this part of the test being unhappy, and walked out unhappy.I tried to EQ some of the faults but did not get far.  Getting rid of response below 30 Hz helps with distortion as usual.  Fixing resonances seemed to do some good but tonality would change too.  So I gave up.Testing for ability to play deep bass was a fail when playing this track from Burak Malçok's album: Sakli Nefes, Toz RuhuThe very low frequency bass is almost inaudible but it easily caused the P5 woofer to bottom out.  I swapped out the P5 for Revel M16 and it too struggles with this track but played at probably 2X the level (still insufficient).ConclusionsI tell you, this is a depressing day.  I run into Paul at shows and we always talk about his time at NRC, etc.  As I have noted all along, nothing about this speaker follows said research.  Price pressure must have been way too high and severe compromises made.  As a statement of where the press is, John Atkinson after talking about all the flaws in the measurements of the P5, finishes with:Was reality suspended when John got to the conclusion section?  How can this be an excellent response with variations in on-axis response, resonances, port noise/resonance, etc., all of which were observed by JA?But no, while Paul I am sure capable of excellent design, the Alpha P5 is definitely not an example of such.  Let's hope we get one of the higher end models of PSB to test soon, lest this poor impression sticks in our mind forever about the brand.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I am too depressed in the way this speaker review came out.

1329,7339f0f9-10a0-4bd6-b70b-a83bcd5e1f68,Standmount/Bookshelf Speaker,Celuaris,SPK5 Purifi,,,,11/23/20,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/purifi-spk5-speaker-review-prototype.17806/,3.0,"This is a review of the Purifi SPK5 reference speaker design for their PTT6.5W04-01A 6.5 Inch Woofer.  It was built and sent to me by the company, Celuaris (member @sgoldwin).  The unit was shipped from UK and did not travel well.  Just about everything that could come loose, did come loose.  I had to take the back apart and reconnect everything and solder a few components in the Purifi crossover board.  Final product from the company will not have these issues.  Still, I think we can get a lot of valuable data from the design as is.EDIT: An updated sample was tested that fixed the enclosure leakage.  As such please refer to new measurements than the ones here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ds/celuaris-spk5-purifi-review-speaker.20125/Celuaris has built the speaker to Purifi spec and visually it looks to be so:The backside is butchered up by me opening it back together (screws were very stiff resulting in me stripping a bunch  ).The port is ""S"" shaped inside.  There was barely enough room for it inside and since it was not glued together, it may not be in the optimal position as designed.The crossover board is external and uses Purifi layout and build:I did not appreciate the black silkscreen/solder mask one bit.  It completely covered the traces making it very hard for me to figure out what went where.  Why on earth a development board was taught to be better this way?  Confusing the implementer can't be a good thing.  I expect more from Purifi.  Looks should be secondary to easy of use.Note that the bent components is my fault.    I had to flip it multiple times and they started to loose their straight orientation.  Fortunately electrons don't care.  As you see, fancy capacitors and such are used throughout.  Combined with high cost of the Purifi woofer ($365?), this would not be a cheap speaker if so dressed.For my testing I had to put the crossover on top of the speaker separated by a 2 inch piece of foam.  The Klippel NFS robotic scanner goes around the speaker and nothing can be separate from it or it will dangle.  I don't think that made much of a difference in measurements but thought I mention it.Note that this test is for experienced readers to analyze the design components here and less so about the finished speaker.  Company plans to send me one of those later for proper review.The measurements were made at about 61 degrees F which was comfortable to me but not if you are from a sunny place.  I used over 1000 measurement points which gave me less than 1% error for most of the spectrum with the exception of 2.5 to 8 kHz where the error crept up a bit more to around 2%.Purifi SPK5 Measurements: Spinorama Frequency ResponseAs usual we start with anechoic response of the speaker plotted in multiple ways:Well, this is not that good.  Starting from left, we have a dip in upper bass frequencies.  Things get better until we start to approach the crossover frequency and now we face a broad dip from 1.2 kHz to some 7 kHz!  There was talk of Purifi adjusting the crossover region, pushing it up to 3.5 kHz.  Don't know if that is the cause but what is there is definitely not optimal.  We then hit a resonance around 8 kHz and a few more peaks with elevated response from the tweeter.I researched other measurements and while there is some agreement with this data, they vary fair bit so I thought I dig in to see if what we have is correct.  Let's start with near-field response of various radiating sources:I had to adjust the port level so don't take that as absolute.  What is strange about the port is that it does not augment the low frequency response of the woofer as we normally see.  It simply reinforces what it can produce as is.  I could be OK with it but not that sharp resonance that follows between 300 and 400 Hz.  That corresponds with a dip in our frequency response so perhaps this is out of phase and sucks out the energy in that region.Moving to the next region, that crossover region doesn't look right to me.  We have that long and gradual slope for the woofer before dropping like a rock.  Yet the tweeter has a sharper slope.  Can't imagine those summing correctly.  They do agree with the electrical measurements of the crossover as provided by Purifi though:The red curve when applied to near flat response of the woofer by itself (as provided by Purifi) will result in what I have measured.  So we are seeing the response as designed.  Just doesn't sum well.Next is the resonances in the tweeter.  I looked up the specs for the Mundorf AMT AMT 21CM 2.1 tweeter and this is what they show:A very large vertical scale of 80 dB (as opposed to standard 50 dB) helps to hide the same peaks we see in our measurements as marked.  Was there not better choices here?Purifi shows the following measurements which were sadly gated and in-room and hence, lack the resolution to see the port problems:Notice that the tweeter ringing is there.  What is different is that they show same ringing in the crossover region which hides the wide dip that I measured.  Disappointing that a company like Purifi would not bother getting a proper anechoic measurement.  If they had, these problems may have been fixable.Anyway, going back to our regular programming, here is the early window reflections:It seems to be more ""correct"" which helps tame the on-axis response issues when we look at the combined result:Horizontal beam width shows decent response until the narrow width tweeter starts to beam toward the end (gets directional):And the same as contour plot:Vertical dispersion says you better stay at tweeter level or slightly below:Purifi SPK5 Distortion MeasurementsThe main claim to fame of the Purifi woofer is lower distortion.  So let's look at our standard measurements:Ignoring the bass for a moment, I am not happy to see the rising distortion in lower treble.  Anyone want to guess as to the source?Here is our 96 dBSPL @1 meter graph:Was hoping to see nothing above 50 dBSPL but we have fair bit.  I leave it up to you all to dig up past measurements and compare to other speakers with similar sized woofer.The distortion amount is much worse than what Purifi shows from my quick look.  Looking at contributions to it, I see a lot more of it from the port than the woofer.  My reassembly of the speaker may have something to do with this as well.  Not sure.Here is the impedance graph:Our port issue/resonance is clearly apparent.  Can't figure out the messiness around 30 to 40 Hz though.  Anyone has a guess for that?Since this is an ultra technical write up, I thought I include the waterfall/CSD plot as well:I have not tried to adjust thresholds and such.  But we can see some of the same issues we have seen in other measurements.Purifi SPK5 Speaker Listening TestsI placed the speaker in my usual stand in my listening room with the crossover separated from it (my poor Revel Salon 2 speaker acted as a crossover stand!).  I always start with female music tracks to see if the highs are produced well without being too bright or recessed.  Well, here they were clearly recessed and not that nice.  So the EQ tool came right out resulting in this set after fair bit of experimentation:The corrections follow the response errors.  Lifting up the upper bass resulted in much needed bass energy as without it, there is just not a lot of it there.  Broad EQ around 2500 Hz dealt with the crossover deficiency quite well, lifting the female vocals out and giving them the treatment they need: a bit brilliant and forward without it being too much.  Actually, it was a too much at first without the higher frequency corrections.  A PEQ dialed to lower the resonance at 8 kHz was very helpful as was the quick shelving filter above that.At first I had the room mode dip active but as noted, there is not a lot of bass coming out of this speaker so I took it out.  This helped and by this time, the response was very nice and high quality.  Lots of detail without any bass notes becoming overbearing.  It was a bit like getting rid of a room mode using EQ and the feeling of relief you get after that.I played by ""speaker killer tracks"" and the SPK5 handled them quite well up to a point which was way ahead of what most small woofers can handle.  It then followed with a bit of distortion.  The woofer was going nuts as far as excursion by this time which would have really messed up the sound of other woofers.  Push a bit more though and you are greeted with a static pop that implies the coil getting outside of the magnetic field.There was a big miss though and that was any kind of physical bass response.  Even at much elevated levels, you could barely feel the bass.  You could hear it well and on techno tracks, celebrated it.  But as a sensation which I crave, almost none was there.  I wonder if this is due to the tuning of the poor which doesn't lower the response range.Overall experience was a very light on its feet speaker that produced very satisfying sound with equalization.  With out, it would not be my cup of tea.ConclusionsGreat to see innovations in woofer technology.  Alas, the lesson of research in the last four decades was ignored in this development reference design: getting the tonality right.  There could not be a more clear example here.  I don't care how low the distortion is if you screw up the vocals.  Or sound too bright.  Fix these -- as I did with EQ -- and then the lower distortion of the bass (appears to ) come forward.Thinking out loud, I wonder how much bass energy we loose by lowering distortion.  Harmonics of low frequencies perceptually would raise the total energy in that region.  I wonder if this, together with port issue, was behind lack of sufficient impact in bass response.I am left thinking if a 6.5 inch driver is the right choice for this technology.  Maybe an 8 inch driver would have been a better showcase so that we could have bass and low distortion.  Alternatively maybe other designs would do better.  I don't know.  What I do know is that this was not a good attempt by Purifi to showcase their speaker.Let's hope some issues here are due to difficulty I had in putting this speaker in working condition.  I welcome detailed analysis from you all though on how it could be improved if the problems are real.Overall I cannot recommend the Purifi SPK5 without equalization.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a local member and costs US $120 including free shipping on Amazon (for a pair).  So definitely in the extreme budget category.You certainly are not going to be impressed with fit and finish of this speaker:There are reports of people getting the speaker with the tweeter rattling inside as it is glued apparently!The woofer is large (good for bass) but with no waveguide and tweeter distanced from it, it is likely going to have directivity errors (direct sound not matching reflected ones).The back panel is definitely utilitarian but does the job:Peaking inside the port, there is no stuffing that I can see.There are 429 ratings on Amazon with average of 4.5 with most raving about its sound.  There are a few people with two stars though which complain about harsh highs that get to you after short listening.  As a buyer, you would be confused as hell trying to integrated these wildly differing views and will likely believe the positives.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 700 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker. Measurement axis is the tweeter center.Temperature was 78 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:This is not good.  Response is uneven and much elevated high frequencies.  Directivity also falls apart (distance between black and blue dashed line changes).  This means the sound will be room dependent as you see from early reflection curve:So whether you have a thick carpet or not, will determine if you see a large or small dip around 3 kHz.Predicted in-room response is not pretty as a result:Some of the uneven frequency response is due to odd choice of crossover point:Notice that the woofer in red keeps going to some 7 kHz with its ups and downs after 3 kHz (I read some place that crossover point is 3.5 kHz).  This may have been intentional to juice up the highs as much as they could as that adds to the tweeter energy.Impedance is reasonably high which makes it an easier load on the amplifier:We see a few kinks in the graphs which indicates resonances (parts of the speaker singing when those tones come at it). I played with the waterfall graph to show more time and low level response:Personally I think it shows too much stuff that offends the eye but perhaps not the ear.  Let me know if you want this new format from here on.  Not promising if I will listen to you though.  Directivity Speaker ResponseWhat we hear is the sum of direct and reflected sounds.  Ideally these would be similar but they clear are not here.  Let's start with our beam width:Man, this is out of control.  There is no attempt to get the off-axis response to be similar to on-axis.  We see it more dramatically in our 3-D chart of the same:I think this is the worst horizontal directivity plot we have seen. Vertically 2-way speakers are not usually good but this is worse yet:Speaker Distortion MeasurementsSpeaker tests have become very resource and time intensive as of late.  So for this speaker I did not use my Audio Precision and am only going to show Klippel results:Starting on the left, letting the woofer play too high is resulting in elevated distortions (my guess).  At 96 dB, distortion is everywhere and at all frequencies more or less.Here is the absolute level:Speaker Eye Candy VisualizationHaven't done this in quite a while but I thought I examine the sounfield around where woofer breaks up:We see a lot of sound sources interfering with each other.  For grins, here is the phase response at the same frequency:With this phase salad, anyone who talks about phase mattering better put aside that argument.Speaker Listening TestsLet me tell you: there is marketing wisdom behind the sound of this speaker. At first listening, the highs are so distinct and stand out so well that you think you have world's highest resolution speaker!  No wonder there are so many reviews about it sounding good.  And the more deaf you are in the high-end, the more you will like it!It did not take me long though as I played through my tracks that I realized how bright it can be.  On some notes it is so sharp that the sound spears through one ear, hits my brain, and comes out the other ear!Vocals generally sound OK but lisping can be pronounced both in level and distortion.On the positive front, the larger than normal woofer brings warmth and ability to play really loud.I suspect the preference score for this speaker will be poor but I bet many of you in blind tests will score it high.It was not until I applied some EQ to fix its response that I realized how broken it sounded:The aggressive and blunt roll off in my low pass filter tames the highs very well.  Turning it on and off showed the seductive aspects of elevated highs but also how bothersome they were getting.Once there I played electronic bass heavy tracks and was turned off by the tubbiness and unpleasant nature of them.  So I decided to put in the filter in yellow to bring their levels down as predicted in the measurements.  That improved them fair bit but the end result still was not great.I tried my high pass filter but even at 30 Hz, it took away ""good bass"" so I left it there.When all was done, the result was much more pleasant but I could still hear unnatural grittiness and distortion in vocal high frequencies.ConclusionsI tell you: this is such a battle of correct design, response, and hi-fi listener wanting to hear ""detail, resolution, etc.""  I would love to blind test this speaker against our reference ones to see how well it does.The large woofer and ability to play loud is a strong plus.  Too often we are getting these tiny woofers in budget speaker which may measure well but don't produce loud, good bass.Anyway, I can't recommend the BIC DV62si even though I understand why the popular vote is so strongly in its favor.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I tell you, this speaker review business is tough.

Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.For reference point, I used the tweeter axis. The main grill was removed.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We seem to enjoy smooth and flat response to 1 kHz and then hell breaks loose for a while.  Directivity is shot at 1 kHz and on-axis remains poor to 3 kHz.  Even beyond we have somewhat uneven response with some peaking above 7 kHz which may make the direct sound too bright.Looking at the driver responses gives us a clue as to the underlying problem:I wonder why the crossover frequency was picked to be so high (4 kHz).  It might be that the small enclosure around it is too small to allow lower frequency response.  Touching the tube behind it while playing music, it sure resonated well as if it was an alternate driver!  This actually caused problems for the Klippel system's field separation.  It confused the that with the room reflection and caused significant error.  I adjusted the measurement parameters and fixed it but clearly this speaker has problem in this mid region.  It is like two speakers stacked on top of each other -- one for woofer and port, and another for tweeter.Back to our spinorma measurements, here is our early reflections:Blending of the reflections and direct axis smoothens the response some:Had to know where to draw the trend line visually.  As shown it will likely sound recessed in mids but slightly emphasized lows and highs which is supposed to be good in a showroom.Distortion in bass was kept in check which was nice:Impedance graph shows a resonance around 1 kHz:Beamwidth is usually prescriptive but I think in this case it makes things look too good:The -6 dB line in red is quite good and smooth.  But then the drop off to -12 dB (pink) is quite uneven.  We can see this better in our traditional contour graph:Vertical directivity narrows in the problem area so best to make sure the speaker stand places the tweeter at your ear height:Speaker Listening TestsThe instant, ""out of box"" impression was, ""this is not bad....""  Ten seconds later though you realize there is too much highs although they seemed to be quite clean.  With female vocals, the voices were as if they were coming through a mask.  There was a low frequency overtone that shrouded them.A bit of EQ made a big difference:The boost in the 1 to 3 kHz brought out vocals and now made them be center stage as they should be.  A/B test showed that even male vocals were suffering without this correction.There was still too much highs but that is easy to fix to taste.Dynamic capability was quite good.  Yes, I could get them to bottom out but otherwise, they could play very loud.  I put in a high pass filter at 35 Hz which fixed the bottoming out but then subjectively there was too little bass so I left it off in the above settings.  The 805S definitely plays louder and cleaner than your typical budget bookshelf.  Its larger enclosure definitely helps with that.ConclusionsA veteran high-end audio dealer once told me that the only two brands of speakers worth selling were Martin Logan and B&W.  Both would draw customers to your door rather than you looking for them.  The iconic look of the B&W shows why that is the case.  Design wise though, this is a clearly flawed execution.  Who would wish to have the frequencies in 1 to 4 kHz screwed up and recessed in their speakers???  While not so obvious when you just listen to them, correct them with EQ and you don't want to listen to them without it.There is a feeling of quality to the speaker that saved it from getting a ""headless panther"" rating.  Bass and dynamic performance is quite good.  And the highest -- despite being excessive -- seemed clean.Personally I would want a speaker to be much more perfect than this so can't recommend the B&W 805S.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Picked a few ripe sunflowers couple of weeks ago.  Left them on the porch to dry but that was not doing the job as it doesn't get much sun there.  So I decided to bring them inside, pull the seeds and dry them individually.  Check out this ""mammoth"" sunflower:I put my hand in there for scale.  It is probably 16 inches across if not more.  The birds had helped themselves to portion of it on top as you see (happy to share the harvest with the little fellows).  After pulling all the ripe seeds (not an easy job), here is how much I had:They have such a sweet flavor and soft texture at this stage which is to die for.  I had saved the seeds for this plan years ago and was so happy to see them still viable.  They grew to 10+ feet with little water and tough soil at the end of our garden.  Nothing screams ""garden"" more than sunflowers.That was the highlight of the day.  Couldn't enjoy it for long as our septic tank overflowed early once again and we are without facilities until Thursday when we get it pumped.    Using our camper van for toilet.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:At first the measurements look very flawed but if we focus in, the response is actually quite good between 100 Hz to about 3 kHz.  Then we lose energy before some kind of resonance around 11 kHz gives us a bit back.  Directivity is also good until the graphs bunch up around 4 kHz to 5 kHz region (crossover is supposed to be 3 kHz).  Smaller woofers tend to make directivity errors smaller because they are closer in size to the small tweeters.Efficiency is around 84 dB which is fairly low as expected.Early window reflections which are the strongest sum up to a smooth response:So room dependency should be low.Putting the two together we get a surprisingly good predicted-in-room response:I noted that the regression line slopes down to the tune of 10 dB.  This will be a good exercise to see if this if the results are too dull or right.Drive responses shows some mismatch leading up to the crossover region:Doesn't seem to be that the Crossover is really at 3 kHz.  Note that this is the acoustic crossover, not electronic.Impedance dips down to below 4 ohm as is typical in most speaker we measure:Beamwidth is pretty flat and reasonably wide:Color coding the amplitude in contour map says the same:Vertical directivity is typical so try to stay from slightly below tweeter to above it:Otherwise you fall in that response ditch and loose energy in the important upper mid-range area.EDIT: forgot to post the distortion graphs originally:Carmody S2000 Speaker Listening TestsCursory look at the frequency response measurements would say this speaker should not sound good.  But good sound it produced!  Not only initially but through a full suite of tracks covering every genre and tonality.  Most impressive were male vocals which had a wonderful warmth to them courtesy of the slight bass boost (and possibly reduction of high frequencies).  Female vocals were nice too with no lispiness.  Track after track was reproduced well and a nice diffused aura around the speaker.A very nice characteristic was power handling.  I could turn it up and up and it simply did not degrade like a lot of budget speakers do.  When presented with deep bass, it simply did not play them.  I have learned to appreciate this over a speaker that tries to play them but then distorts, bottoms out, etc.  Don't do what you can't do I say!There is one flaw there though: if the content of the music track is mostly low frequency, the level drops way down almost making you think someone lowered the volume way down.  This made a few tracks not listenable.  Actually I could listen to them by turning up the volume but then was afraid of the next loud note blowing them up!  ConclusionsI will confess that I hate doing reviews like this.  Objective scores are likely to be low creating a lot of cries of ""how could you like it so much.""  Early on in my speaker testing I realized that what is important to my ears is good response from 200 to 2000 Hz.  Dips in that region can be really problematic as there is so much ""life"" in music in that region.  Testing this speaker made me realize perhaps I don't like as much high frequency content and want a more sloped down response.Something that doesn't jump out of the measurements and is a key reason I listen is power handling.  Yes, I show you the distortion graphs but those are two points and you can't hear what I am hearing.  In this case as I noted, the speaker incrementally gets louder and louder without falling apart like just about every budget speaker.  I want to experience music, not the limitations of the speaker and the S2000 does a very good job here.I imagine nothing is more complicated than getting a cheap, small speaker to sound good.  The components are simplicity in themselves.  But balancing the compromises must be a herculean affair.  Whatever that formula is, it worked for my ears.I suggest giving this build a try.  If you don't want to build them yourself, ask Rick to build them for you.  You will wind up with a unique speaker that sounds really good, and fits everywhere.I am happy to give a strong recommendation to Carmody S2000 DIY Speaker.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is rather old unit but since we have no Tannoy speakers in our database I thought it would be good to review.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I don't know what it cost when new.The concentric driver sure looks weird:It looks like it had a dust cap which was ripped out (but is not).Funny bit is that when I was test it from some 6 feet away at high SPL, I was getting a strong breeze on my cheeks from the front ports!  It also produced audible secondary tones during speaker sweeps.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 0.7 Hz (yes, less than 1 Hz) and plots are at 20 points/octave. Spatial 3-D resolution is 1 degree.Nearly1000 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field until about 16 kHz.  Error then rose up to 2% at 20 kHz. Final database of measurements and data is 1.4 Gigabytes in size. In order to speed up the publication of these reports, this review is somewhat abbreviated.  Full data is enclosed though.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: I don't need to tell you that this is a very poor response.  There is a huge suck out at the crossover frequency as the two drivers don't overlap properly.  We also have peaking prior to that dip and general mismatch to higher frequencies.  In essence, no measurement seems to have been used to optimize this design.Predicted in-room response is therefore awful:Here is the impedance measurement:Speaker Distortion MeasurementsI dedicated a couple of days to bettering the distortion measurements.  First and foremost, I used the Klippel compensation system to produce anechoic distortion measurements from in-room!  This means I can now show full spectrum of the distortion down to 20 Hz without any room modes or reflections messing up the display.  It is not as useful in this instance but will be when we measure subwoofers.Second bit was a suggestion by a member to also measure distortion at higher voltage.  Up until now, I have only shown that at 2.83 volts at the speaker terminal.  Now I am also measuring at four times that (around 10 volts).  Here are the results:We see that the level sensitive distortion is at lower frequencies.  The rest are not scaling that much with level although there are differences.Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsBecause of the concentric driver, vertical and horizontal axis are quite similar.  Similarly bad that is due to that suck out which you can clearly see in these graphs:Speaker Listening TestsNo time as the big pile of speakers waiting to be reviewed is threatening to fall on me....ConclusionsThe Tannoy System 600 seems to have been designed based on ideas and principals, as opposed to verification with measurements.  I am sure someone will educate me about the genius behind this design.  The data shows the speaker to be highly colored and really not something you want to put in your system.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I was looking at my paypal balance on the computer today when my wife was walking by a floor down commented: ""you seem to not have taken in enough donations!""

I don't remember what it cost me but the current price in black is US $429 from the company direct.I must say, I am very pleased with the way they look:I guess I have a soft spot for white woofers.  I also like the rather serious look of that tweeter.Back panel shows a couple of screws which should make it much easier to hang this from walls for your side and rear channels:Screw binding posts are too close together making it a pain to tighten or loosen them.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Using computational acoustics, far-field response is computed and that is what I present. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of about 1%. Clean high frequency response is responsible for ease of measurement in this regard.Reference axis is approximately the center of the tweeter. Grill was not used.HTD Level Three MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: The only word that comes to my mind is ""wow"" as is ""wow, that is bad!""  There are so many problems here.  First and foremost is the peaking tweeter response as frequencies climb.  The overall response is so jagged and we have some sudden anomalies.  Sensitivity is also quite low as evidenced by me having to turn up the gain to measure the speaker by some 4 to 5 dB above average speaker.  For some clues as to why the response is so bad, I disconnected the rear binding posts from upper and lower halves and measured the tweeter and woofer independently:We clearly see some of the issues behind our frequency response errors.  The port is letting out some nasty resonances and the tweeter response is anything but smooth and flat.Even the impedance measurement shows us something seriously is wrong:One can say that getting proper frequency response is difficult for smaller companies but impedance measurements are dead simple.  Whatever is going on around 260 Hz should have been found and dealt with.  While on this graph, unlike many speakers, the minimum impedance is ht around 2 khz to the tune of 3.6 ohm.  For bass frequencies it is above 6 ohm which is good.Back to our ""spin"" information, let's look at the early and strongest reflections in a typical room:We see many of the same problems here.  As noted, if you put an absorber behind your seating position (your back wall, speaker's ""front wall""), it may help with the extra brightness.Predicted in-room response smooths out some of the problems but leaves a lot:There is some good news in the form of very good directivity control of the tweeter in the horizontal dimension:Vertically is a mess but so are many 2-way speakers:Getting proper distortion measurements is hard because the frequency response is so wild.  I adjusted it for mid-range levels and got these:These are some of the worst distortion measurements on record but note that many of the issues are narrow peaks so audibility will not be as bad it may look.HTD Level 3 Listening TestsThe immediate reaction was the extreme shrillness of the highs.  It is over the top unless you have lost all of your high frequency hearing in which case, it sounds fine.    This ""showroom sound"" can sound appealing -- for a bit at least -- so please don't write that you don't think it sounds bright.  Measurements say so as do my ears.  But the overall feeling of clarity that such overboosted highs present is hard to deny.There is some cleverness in the bass response in that this speaker can play very loud without bottoming out.  It simply filters out deep bass that it can't play so fits its intended usage of home theater sound with subs and such.  At times, I enjoyed listening to them despite all the flaws there.  This may be due to controlled horizontal directivity.I did not bother to develop an EQ.  There are just too many issues here to deal with.  Best to get a better speaker that doesn't require so many fixes.ConclusionsObjectively the HTD Level 3 is a disaster.  Clearly no measurements were performed to verify efficacy of the design.  That said, while some aspects like high frequency boost are clearly audible and annoying, the rest of the response hurt the eye more than the ear.  Bass tuning is clever to keep the speaker from distorting and hence allowing it to play quite loud.  And there is something to that wide and controlled horizontal directivity that I can't quantify but I think contributed to sound that is not nearly as bad as measurements show.We could look at this speaker as a puzzle given the huge number of flaws in its design but yet, not so horrible sound and try to figure out what is going on.  Me?  I just rather get a good speaker that doesn't make me spend this kind of effort on it.    The designer should do more than is delivered here so my work is touch up and no more.I can't recommend the HTD Level Three and curse all of you who made me buy it.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs around US $10,000 (varies due to color).I am not a fan of the way the front looks without the grill.  The sides though sport probably the best finish I have seen on a speaker with deep gloss and polish.  Speaker is also incredibly heavy and stiff for its size (29 pounds or 13 Kg).  Drivers are custom versions of Scan-speak Revelator.There is a down title rectangular port in the back:I put in the very well designed dense foam plug that fits the port exceptionally well.  In testing it really plugged the port unlike foam ones which half of the time feel like they are not doing anything.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was the center of the tweeter (aligned by eye). The grill was not used. It is getting colder with the measurement room temp at 14 degrees C. Accuracy is better than 1% for almost entire audio spectrum indicating a well designed speaker.Wilson Audio TuneTot MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:On-axis response clearly doesn't look even.  There is a massive peak around 115 Hz then real messiness around or near the crossover region.  Directivity is lost around 3 kHz as well.  Exploring the impact of the port, we see why that peak is there in bass:Very strange to see the port tuned to boost the response at such a high frequency rather than extending it lower.Oddly again, the sum of the early reflections is better behaved than on-axis:This causes the predicted in-room response to be much smoother than you would expect from looking at our original spin graph:As we could already guess, beamwidth is not uniform indicating room dependency:Radiation pattern is wider than usual though which should give a more spacious impression than a point source around the speaker:Vertically you lose some margin due to slanted baffle so best to not go above tweeter axis:Distortion is kept very low at 86 dBSPL but I could hear a resonance during 96 dPSPL:To rule out the Klippel stand from contributing to this, I literally held the speaker above it as the sweep ran and I could hear the resonance at a specific frequency.  Strangely the frequency response drops there so the resonance must be out of phase.  Here is the near-field response:I only see minor variations of the woofer response so hard to say if the above is really the problem.  I did like the fact that the port/cabinet resonances are kept low.  Woofer response does step up some though and is reflected in the frequency response (between 700 Hz and 1 kHz).  Is this due to too little baffle compensation?Impedance is above average which should make it easier on the amplifier:There is a sign of that resonance at 2.6 kHz that we saw in the distortion measurements.Waterfall response shows a number of resonances corresponding with peaks in response:For fans of timing analysis, here are the impulse and step response (yes, phase is inverted -- I need to fix this):Wilson TuneTot Listening Tests and EqualizationListening test system was a custom, silent Roon Server/Player ($2,000) connected to Matrix X-Sabre MQA DAC ($2,000), and Mark Levinson Reference Amplifier ($20,000, 400 watts/channel) playing custom tracks developed for testing headphones and speakers.I started playing with the port open.  With my female vocal tracks, the extra bass was not all that bad and compensated partially the slight brightness of the speaker.  But when I played content with much bass content, it became overwhelming.  I plugged the port but then there was not much bass to satisfy.  So I removed the plug and deployed a few filters:The first dip should be self-explanatory to remove the extra bass boost.  Doing this from anechoic measurements is tricky though as in-room response likely looks very different.  So I adjusted this by ear and admittedly on some tracks I wanted slightly more of it.  With this filter in place the bass was now tighter and overall sound of the speaker more open.  Per above though, there was some brightness that gave me hell to deal with.  Likely due to bad directivity and mismatch of on and off-axis, using an electronic filter that impacts both is very challenging.I eventually gave up on optimizing using on-axis response and roughly used the Predicted In-Room Response (by eye) to develop the two other mild filters.  I performed a number of blind tests and overall I preferred the equalized response.  There is a caveat that you need to know what good and clean bass is and the overall proper tonality.  Otherwise, the ""showroom sound"" aspect of this speaker can be seductive making you want to listen to boosted bass and slightly elevated highs.For comparison, I switched back and forth a dozen times with Revel M106 speaker ($2,000).  The Revel had a smaller halo and sounded more focused than the TuneTot.  It had none of the brilliance of the Tunetot but his was a dual edged sword in that the TuneTot constantly gave the impression of a more detailed, and ""audiophile"" high frequency notes that were very nicely delineated.  TuneTot also had deeper and cleaner bass response than the M106.  Overall, I preferred the TuneTot over Revel.I briefly compared the TuneTot to my Revel Salon 2 ($23,000).  Revel did not have the exaggerated spatial qualities of the high frequencies that TuneTot had but overall presented a much more balanced tonality and of course, much more bass impact.  Its midrange was so smooth and nice.  Still, I was amazed how the TuneTot did not sound small compared to it whereas the M106 did.Sub-bass response on TuneTot was better than I expect from a small speaker.  Push it though and the woofer starts to make bad sounds as they all do in this size factor and playback levels.ConclusionsThere is no question that there are some clear objective/engineering errors in the design of Wilson TuneTot.  The port is tuned too high and the on-axis/directivity response is poor.  What is strange though that the impact of these on the fidelity of the speaker is not at all this obvious.  Either I am influenced by the showroom sound as much as the next guy or getting off-axis to be right in my rather reflective room overcomes issues in on-axis response.  It is also possible that all the money that has gone to building such an extremely dense speaker and keeping distortion low is paying benefit here.  One wonders how much better these would sound if they had had preserved all of this and at the same time didn't have the design errors.If I were to just goy by the measurements, the Tunetot would not get good marks.  But I have promised you all that I won't lie about what I hear no matter how much of a conflict this provides.  To that end, I am going to recommend the Wilson TuneTot with equalization (cost not considered)."

It was kindly sent to me by a member and also loaned one by the company. It costs US $600 each.The B10 has a gorgeous glossy piano black finish. That is complimented by the best treatment of an AMT tweeter I have seen, giving the front a nice black finish. The impression is quite positive giving the feeling of a luxury in a small package.  Back panel sports custom binding posts which I wish were color coded:The measurements you are about to see are performed on Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). It produces anechoic measurements at far field per CEA/CTA-2034 standard.  If you are new to my tests, please watch this video on how to understand speaker measurements.Reference axis was the center of the tweeter although I also computed the results for the rim of the woofer but made no difference.Martin Logan B10 Speaker MeasurementsAs usual we start with our anechoic speaker measurements:At macro level, the response is pretty much flat.  We have one peak at around 900 Hz which you will repeatedly see in measurements and slight rising high frequencies from 3 kHz on.  Despite sporting a waveguide, there is still some directivity mismatch as the woofer beam gets too narrow before the tweeter takes over and widens it.  This directivity error has a fair impact on the tonality of the early/important/loudest reflections from the room:Let's dissect this into horizontal and vertical reflections:While non-coaxial 2-ways have some dip vertically, here that is exaggerated and then combined with a less severe one horizontally.  The two put together create a broad deviation from netural:Or is the problem that the treble response is too rich?  Your answer will determine which way you draw the regression line: A or B.  Audible symptoms will be different to be sure.  We will come back to this in listening test section of the review.Back to our 900 Hz resonance, we clearly see that when we make close in measurements of the port in the back:There is also another at double its frequency but its level is lower so not much impact.  Fortunately the port is in the back so it is not as audible especially if you pull the speaker out from the wall (or use an absorber there).For such a small speaker, distortion is very well managed:Notice the trough in distortion indicated by the arrow as the tweeter takes over, relieving the woofer.  That makes me think if the crossover point for the tweeter could have been lower which would have also helped potentially with the directivity error.  Still, I take the ultra low distortion in that region where our hearing is most sensitive.Impedance dips to 3.6 ohm which is low but that is typical of modern speakers:Horizontal beamwidth is 60 degrees in either direction which again is typical:Vertically we have the really deep dip as you get off angle so better listen at tweeter height lest you want to make the directivity error even worse:Waterfall shows what we already know as far as resonances:And as usual, step response tells us little:Martin Logan B10 Listening Tests and EqualizationPrevious review by Erin talked about speaker exaggerating lisping.  That didn't match my listening tests.  Yes, if a track had lisping, it became more pronounced.  But by itself, I didn't hear it doing much of that, if at all.  Overall impression of the speaker was that it was doing something right as there was nice fidelity across a lot of my reference tracks.  With a speaker that has poor tonality, that percentage drops precipitously.  Not here.  Yes, there was a bit of brightness but nothing to the point of standing out a lot.  Still, I thought I pull that down to see what happens:The shelving filtering did NOT at all have the expected result.  It made the speaker sound dull resulting in my preferring the stock result better due to that.  I played around with that filter for 15 to 20 minutes but no matter what I did, it just didn't improve fidelity.  So I went after pulling down that resonance.  The result there was quite subtle due to high Q (narrowness) of the filter.  But it managed to take out a bit of harshness.As is typical of many speakers, there is a hump around 100 Hz which is close to a room mode I have.  That causes a track or two to sound boomy.  So I dialed in my usual filter there.  Counterintuitively, that improved bass response in that the sound was not only more tight, but also less harsh.  My explanation for that is the we are reducing spray of harmonic distortion from the woofer which travels to high frequencies.With the above two filters in place, the fidelity was improved slightly but still something was not optimal.  I went back and forth with my Revel Salon 2 and M106 and M16 bookshelves I have on hand for this type of testing.  Both Salon 2 and M16 had a tonality balance that I was not hearing in B10.I then looked at the PIR response:Even though we think directivity errors are not correctable, research into room EQ shows that it is worthwhile trying to correct them.  That would call for line A to be correct, needing to fill in the region between 1 and 3 kHz.  This resulted in yellow filter #4. I tested this by itself and it nicely increased instrument separation (much like I hear in headphones with the same problem) with better fidelity overall.While I really like the effect of the yellow filter on lower treble, I thought speaker sounded a bit bright.  Now putting in the shelving filter did the job bringing in the highs in balance.I spent the next half hour tuning the last two filters and where I got them was optimal across large number of reference tracks.Despite the plurality of filters, the overall effect is subtle but bested the stock tuning which now sounded a bit dull.  Performance was very enjoyable across every reference track I throw at the B10.On sub-bass performance, those frequencies were reproduced but with mild amount of distortion which I like.  Techno tracks though lacked enough bass response so you should consider getting a sub to go with this speaker.ConclusionsOne likes to think that after testing some 300 speaker, it would be walk in the park to analyze the performance of a speaker like B10.  That was not the case.  Even though measurements clearly show a couple of design compromises, figuring out their significance and audible impact was quite non-trivial.  I spent more time evaluating this speaker in listening section than many others. I think this has partially to do with directivity error which is harder to get the pulse of, and the goodness of very low distortion speaker in 2 to 5 kHz -- something that keeps reminding you that this speaker is doing something right.So where we land is that we have a gorgeous looking speaker that has a good stock sound in my opinion but can be improved to be near reference quality with some EQ help.I am going to recommend the Martin Logan B10 speaker.Manufacturer Specifications:Dimensions (H x W x D, with feet) 12-1/2” x 7” x 9-3/4” 31.8cm x 17.8cm x 24.8cmFrequency Response: 56 Hz - 25 kHz ± 3 dBTweeter Dispersion (horizontal x vertical); 90° x 90°Recommended Amplifier Power: 20 - 200 wattsSensitivity: 92 dBImpedance: 5 ohmsHigh Frequency Driver: 1” x 1.4” (2.6 x 3.6cm) Gen2 Obsidian Folded Motion Tweeter with 9.2 in2 (59.4 cm2) diaphragmCrossover Frequency: 2,370 Hz (2-way)Mid-Frequency Drivers: 5.5” (14cm) Woven Fiberglass cone with cast polymer basket.

It was kindly sent in by a member for review.  It came out in 2014 and has been discontinued.  It cost US $1,500 then.  I see used ones at almost that price.While somewhat plain due to black finish, there is still some style in this Danish speaker:The cabinet feels dense and there is good bit of weight to the X14.  Here is the back panel:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:On-axis response is not as flat as I like to see from a company like Dynaudio.  Due to lack of waveguide to control the width of the tweeter beam at its lowest crossover setting, it doesn't match the woofer's causing that dip in the index.Individual driver and port response shows some of the reasons for the uneven response:Looks to me like that port resonance is boosting the lower midrange between 500 and 100 Hz.  Crossover matching is not perfect either.  Tweeter has a nice flat response until it doesn't above 10 kHz.Early window reflections show the problem we already know about:Highly suggest having a thick carpet to absorb the floor reflections around 2 kHz as I do.  Needs to be about 2 inches or so to be effective there.Predicted in-room response is such:Depending on where you draw the regression line, there is too much energy in the lower and upper treble which can make the speaker sound bright.Beamwidth shows the lack of directivity control:See how the laws of physics control the directivity of the tweeter, narrowing its beamwidth as frequencies go up.  We want this to be horizontal so that the off-axis response matches on-axis and we don't have a lot of room dependency.Distortion is good for this type of speaker:Horizontal contour map shows our issue with directivity again:Seems like the speaker was not fully aligned horizontally so the on-axis response may be a bit worse or better than what the spin shows.Here is our vertical which is not bad:You have good bit of leeway on how high you place the speaker relative to your ears.Edit: forgot the impedance graph:Dynaudio X14 Speaker Listening TestsFirst impression was good.  I could enjoy my female reference tracks which is where I always start.  But I thought I make some corrections in the response and see how much better it gets:Ignore the one at 102 Hz as that is for room mode.  The rest helped a lot and nicely transformed the speaker.  The bit of brightness was gone and clarity was improved with the boost in 2 kHz.  The dip around 800 Hz also helped with clarity which could be due to reduction of port resonance.With EQ in place, the X14 produce very good dynamics with surprising clarity. Distortion would only gradually set it as I pumped a ton of power into it.  Indeed I felt no need to test its limits as it was already doing better than it should be.ConclusionsOur of the box, the objective performance of the Dynaudio X14 is not that great.  Despite its rather high price, there is no waveguide to control directivity.  And response is not as good as it should be on axis.  Mild equalization helped transform it to a capable speaker.  Having been discontinued and expensive, The X14 is not a speaker that I recommend.  But if you can find a cheap pair and use EQ, it can be a very satisfying speaker.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:I must say at first I thought this was rather chewed up.  But if we ignore the upper frequencies above 10 kHz, the rest is not too bad.  We have a bit of peaking around 900 Hz.  And a dip around 3 kHz.Directivity is actually decent which means we can a) EQ the response and b) response will not be too room dependent.The issue at 900 Hz becomes obvious when we look at the nearfield measurements of each sound radiating element:The port becomes a bit crazy above its intended response and generates a couple of peaks.  In addition, we see the tweeter having rather non-flat response.The tweeter seems to have a steeper roll off than the woofer causing the dip in the crossover region.Back to our spinorama, here is our early window reflections:Like most speakers, floor reflections have a large dip and is best avoided with a thick carpet (which my listening room has).Predicted in-room response is:Impedance curve shows the resonances we have discussed:Horizontal beam width is actually quite decent:As is contour of the same:They have made an attempt to narrow the gap between the woofer and tweeter and it shows in better vertical response:Edit: forgot the distortion graphs:Boston A25 Listening TestsI placed the A25 in my usual far-field setting.  First impression was positive.  Certainly better than casual glance of the spin data.  Some touch up EQ nicely lifted the response:I tried to lift the dip but it subjectively made the speaker sound bright on some tracks so I took it off.  As I noted earlier, I have a thick carpet so the predicted in-room response for me is better than what I showed.The first filter is to get rid of distortion.  It took away a bit of bass so you may want to play with it.  The dip to get rid of the resonance was effective of making the sound lighter and vocals to stand out a bit more which I liked.  The final shelving was to get rid of occasional brightness depending on track.  I hate the fact that we have no production standards so sometimes seems impossible to actually tailor the overall ""target curve.""Once there, the sound was quite nice.  I listened for good 30 minutes and track after track sounded beautiful.  Here is an example from Gait Kelin Kromhof:Sorry, there is no youtube track for it.  It is superb music that is very well recorded and it sounded great on the A25.Dynamics were superb here and I could detect no sign of distortion at very high volumes.  That said, if you listen to the port in the back, it sure sounded distorted and badly so.  My back wall is from far from the speaker so I could not hear it from the front.  If your situation is different, then the experience may not be as rewarding as it was for me.ConclusionsThe fit and finish of the Boston Acoustics A25 matches a speaker north of $800 a pair.  It is hard to imagine how they pulled it off at such a low price.  Objectively, the response is not ideal but somehow the mistakes are not that big with respect to audibility and easily corrected.  While the speaker seems discontinued, searching for good prices as I did on clearance is an excellent idea.  You will certainly get a speaker with far more power capability and better tonality than most budget speakers.I am going to put the Boston A 25 on my recommended list.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Could no longer walk in our garage.

It is on kind loan from a member.  The Q100 is discontinued but I think it cost US $550.I always say speaker business is 80% about marketing and KEF has mastered that art:The coaxial driver looks great and caters to audiophile intuition of ""point source being good."" Speaker is lighter than I imagined them being.Here is the back panel:I thought those two knobs were level controls which is surprising in a passive speaker.  Turns out they are just shunting knobs that short the highs and lows together.  Or disconnect them if you want to bi-wire wire/bi-amp them. Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 0.7 Hz (yes, less than 1 Hz) and plots are at 20 points/octave. Spatial 3-D resolution is 1 degree.Over 700 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field up to 16.5 kHz.  After that error climbs to 2% which should not be material.  Final database of measurements and data is 1.2 Gigabytes in size.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We have a broad lift from 700 to 1.5 kHz and another from 5 kHz to beyond 10 kHz.  The actual variation is a few dB but because they are so wide, they will hit a lot more notes so colorations will be a lot more audible.There is a cancellation (notch) at 1.4 kHz which I will address later.Above graph is also our sensitivity.  At mid-frequencies it is 85 dB but drops to 80 dB in bass frequencies.  So you need to have good bit of power to drive it loud.In-room response is more or less what we have on-axis, tilted down:That's it for most major aspect of the speaker that sets listener preference in controlled testing.Basic Speaker MeasurementsImpedance drops to below 4 ohm in bass frequency so you better have a good amplifier to drive it:Here is gated room measurement and distortion with floor of -50 dB:Zooming in we get:Waterfall display shows some of the resonances:Advanced Speaker MeasurementsOne benefit of coaxial drivers is that their vertical dispersion is better than simple 2-way speakers:Eye-candy MeasurementsUsing the power of 1 degree measurement in 3-D space, we can analyze what is going on with the speaker.  To wit, let's see what happens at 1.4 kHz that we had a dip:The ""nref"" arrow is the center of the coaxial driver as you would look into it.  We see that there is a strong sound source below it which has to be the port.  Something coming out of that port is combing with the main driver and causing cancellation in the middle (to some extent). The frequency is 1.4 kHz.  If we convert that to wavelength we get nearly 12 inches which happens to be the height of the cabinet.  So it looks like it is a longitudinal mode of the internal cabinet coming out the port causing that partial cancellation.Note that the bandwidth (""ERB"") of the notch is too small to be that audible.  It is just an interesting thing to analyze nevertheless.   Speaker Listening TestsI used the KEF Q100 in my main system, playing in mono (provides best discrimination).  Experience was not that positive.  Hardly any of my tracks sounded good.  Bass loading was rather high and boomy.  The location causes some of that but seems to be exaggerated here.  There was a general lack of evenness response with some notes forward, some not.  There was also some distortion which seemed to be constant throughout everything I played.  A buzzing type of secondary tones.I believe a port plug comes with the speaker.  For testing, I just stuck my hand in the port.  That nicely lowered the bass boominess and seemed to reduce the distortion I was hearing.  This was in near-field listening because obviously I could not reach with my hand 10 feet.  ConclusionsI think the famous reputation Q100 has more to do with its great looks than sound.  Measurements are not horrible but they lack the evenness that we need to see in on-axis measurements.Overall, I can't recommend the KEF Q100.  Look forward to testing their current production models.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Hate going to the local grocery store on Tuesdays.  Why?

There is now a second variation with their in-house tweeter.  This is the original which I call ""V1.""  The V2 costs US 4,000 which I assume what the V1 cost.  It was kindly sent to me by a member for testing.The SCM19 is by far the heaviest bookshelf speaker I have tested.  You or I should say I, could barely lift it up to the 5 foot high measuring platform.  It clocks at whopping 40 pounds!  Overall look of the unit is on the serious side with a damped industrial looking woofer with seemingly long travel capability:My impression from feeling and picking up the unit was that this is going to be one dynamic speaker.The back panel shows lack of port and dual binding posts:Zooming in we see the pedigree of the speaker:Designed and manufactured in Gloucestershire, England.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker.I usually use the tweeter center as the measurement axis.  The manual for SCM19 states that the acoustic center is between the tweeter and woofer rings so I compensated for that by lowering the measurement center to be 4 centimetres lower.  This made a tiny difference (likely due to size of the speaker and my measurement distance).Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:What???  The heck kind of response is this?  Giant boost in midrange and lower treble?On top of that we have directivity mismatch when the woofer hands the signal to the tweeter. The former's beam is narrowing while the tweeter's is wide resulting in off-axis sound in that region to have different tonality than direct.  In a reversal fortunes, the off-axis looks more proper:Putting the two together we get a predicted in-room response of:We are going to have too little bass with a lot of mid-range and presence.  Given how important bass is to our perception of fidelity (about one third), this seems like the wrong choice of response.I expected the mean looking woofer and high price of the unit to result in very low distortion.  But that was not accomplished either:Here it is in absolute level:The beam width (how wide the region with close tonality is) on the horizontal axis is on the low side at +- 50 degrees:Here it is in 3-d diagram:And vertical:Lack of port removes one of the peaks in our impedance curve:We see a ""kink"" in the impedance/phase graph at around 700 Hz indicating resonance.  That is also the point of high distortion.  It also shows up in CSD/waterfall display:Speaker Listening TestsYou all keep asking me to listen to the speaker before measuring.  So this time as the system was crunching the equations I did precisely that, fully biased on the incredible heft of the speaker and beefy speakers expecting to be blown away by the dynamics.The ""5 second"" impression was an incredible presentation of high frequency notes.  They sounded like they were jumping out of the speaker and reaching toward me.  I thought, ""oh yeh, this is going to be good!""  Then the vocals came.  Hmmm.  They don't sound right.  But yet, enough audiophile tracks.  Let's queue up some bass heavy tracks.What?  Where is the bass?  What is that woofer doing? It sure is not moving much.  I turned up the volume but now the mids and highs were getting quite loud and annoying.At this point I stop and get the measurements and see the lack of bass.  So I pull up the EQ in my Roon player and put on my surgical outfit to fix what shouldn't need fixing.  First thing I did was put in a low shelf to boost the bass:That is filter Band 2.  Was happy for 10 seconds until I turned up the volume and the woofer bottomed out!  I thought for sure it could handle that 2 dB peak.  But no, it was not happy at all.Suspecting that the problem was deep bass, I dialed in Band 3 which cuts out the lowest bass registers.  This has minimal impact on amount of bass but nicely eliminated the woofer from bottoming out (and getting seriously distorted).Now we had a pleasant speaker.  But hey, if am going to play speaker designer with equalization, why did I pay the factory $4,000???ConclusionsATC is another ""PRO"" company producing hi-fi speaker.  My impression of any such company is that they would produce speakers that would have a neutral and balanced frequency response and hence tonality.  I can't fathom how they would produce something like the SCM19.  The results are so poor that I am suspecting my measurements must be wrong.  But then the listening tests confirmed the same.I read that the new version uses in-house tweeter.  That seems like the wrong problem to try to solve.  They should fix the woofer first.Needless to say, I can not recommend the ATC SCM19 (version 1).------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Drive nearly 200 miles today to drop off and pick up some gear to test from local members.

Professional Monitor Company (PMC) is a UK company so keep that in mind when looking at pricing.  Their mainline business is to provide monitors for professional world both in music and cinema.  So my expectations going into this review is that we see neutral response in the design.The overall build of the speaker is excellent:Solid, glossy finish gives a feeling of high quality.  A transmission line exiting out of the front port is one of the differentiators  in the design.The back panel shows the very nice speaker terminals:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Oh, boy!  Nothing like having every one of your expectations about the company dashed in one graph!  What kind of response is this?  Did different people design different parts of the speaker and never talked to each other?  Or is this PMC's idea of what a neutral response looks like?On top of on-axis not being flat, we have directivity error where the woofer starts to ""beam"" (its response narrows) as it gets to the crossover frequency.  This is normal and the solution is typically to put a waveguide around the tweeter since it would start its job with a very wide beam.  None is here so we see the ""DI"" graph show a rather severe dip.  This translates to off-axis response not being similar to on-axis.  Reflections will be tonally different than on-axis making the speaker very room sensitive:Putting all of these together we can try to predict the tonality you may get in your room:The flattish trend line means the speaker will sound bright.  And the two peaks in bass mean there will be strong bass emphasis at certain notes/frequencies.  This tonality will be overlaid on everything you play.  Not a good thing.I split the terminals and drove the tweeter separately from woofer+port in nearfield.  Here is how that looks:Looks like the port tuning is wrong as it is responsible for that bump at 100 Hz where the woofer is already peaking some.  It should have been tuned to higher frequency so that it would fill in the two peaks in the woofer.We also have a lot of distortion:Here is the breakdown per component:The large peak in the port distortion at 200 Hz is interesting.  As is spikes all the way through the spectrum.In absolute terms this is the distortion profile:Fair bit of distortion exceeds my threshold of -50 dB.  This is at 96 dB SPL though.Impedance is nicely high for a bookshelf:Beamwidth is chewed up as we expect based on directivity plot earlier:It is wider than normal because of lack of waveguide.  But gives up smoothness which you can also see in our 3-D plot:I forgot to mention that this speaker tilts back.  That seems to have shifted the center line up some relative to my microphone placement:Finally, here is our waterfall:We see the same distortion peaks around 400 Hz.Speaker Subjective Listening TestsMy first ""5 second"" reaction was: ""this speaker is screechy bright.""  It was so bad it set off my tinnitus.  Female vocals didn't sound terrible but became lispy and after a bit, annoying.The bass was there but strange.  It was not full and it sounded kind of tubby.I put in a low pass filter and pulled the highs down above 5 kHz.  Pushed up the dip in mid-frequencies and knocked off the two bass peaks.   Sorry, lost the EQ setting so nothing to show you.  But I am sure you can guess them from the frequency response.  Once there, the PMC Twenty.21 sounded ""OK.""  The harshness was mostly gone, bass was less but more natural.  And there was more detail.ConclusionsThe PMC Twenty.21 is a failure in design.  It does not follow much of what we know that results in speakers that are neutral and as such, can garner listener preference.  I have no idea how a company with a tradition and core business of pro speakers would make a hifi speaker this bad.  I suspect it was all ""tuned by ear"" which makes me shed a tear for what hearing they must have to produce something like this!Needless to say, I cannot recommend the PMC Twenty.21.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We see good integration between the drivers as the on-axis curve (black) is mostly smooth.  However, it is rising up in level as frequencies climb to 20 kHz.  As a result this speaker should sound rather bright if you full absorb the reflections.Digging into the directivity indices gives us this:Two observations are apparent as noted on the graph.  The early window directivity index (dashed blue) at a glance tells us how similar the on-axis and important reflections are.  If the two were identical, the graph would be a flat line at 0.  If it is rising, it means that the highs are rolled off relative to on-axis/direct sound.  This is fine and a good thing.  What is not a good thing is if you see variations along the line.  And that is what we see.  This means that the sound that bounces from surfaces around your room will have a different frequency response than what you hear.  Speakers like this tend to not do well in controlled, preference testing.The above also means that the sound that you hear will be room dependent with respect to what absorption there is at various angles to the speaker.  Block some of them and the overall response/tonality changes even though the direct response is not changed.  Such kinks also cannot be fixed with EQ because they occur in the room, not upstream of it.Looking at an estimate frequency response you would get in a typical room we get:So depending on what you play, the tonality of the music is changed a lot.  An ideal response would look like the arrow I have drawn.High level analysis is done at this point.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We like to see flat on-axis response as indicated by my arrow in red.  Below about 1 kHz we are surprisingly close to that.  The crossover frequency is at 3 kHz and we can see peaking of the response before it, and droop after it.Early reflections though are smooth (in dashed blue) so that is good.Zooming into ""directivity index"" tells us how close the direct sound of the speaker is relative to what hits all the other surfaces and then arrives at our ear:We see some deviations above 2 kHz but not bad for a budget speaker.If you were to put these in a room (as opposed to desktop), this is the predicted frequency response/tonality of the speaker where we mix the direct sound with reflections:Deviations are small meaning this is more of a neutral speaker.Basic Speaker MeasurementsHere is the impedance (and phase) of the speaker relative to frequency:Anytime there is a kink/little wiggle in the response, it indicates a resonance.  We have at least a couple of these, one around 280 Hz and another at 1.6 kHz.  The former is not showing up in the frequency response measurement so not material.  There are some peaks around 1 kHz in the frequency response which means they are more material than what we are seeing here.Here are distortion measurements which are supposed to be done in anechoic chamber but were not (so ignore data below 200 Hz or so):Advanced Speaker MeasurementsNotice that the early reflections are smoother than on-axis.  Translation: don't follow the mob on the Internet and put absorbers everywhere.I reduced the number of graphs here to better highlight the ones that are likely to be at play in your listening room:On the left I have highlighted 20 and 30 degrees which would show the response if you did NOT toe in the speaker to point at your ear.Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsHere is the soundfield from the speaker at crossover frequency of 3000 Hz:If you had an ideal, full-bandwidth driver, you would get one balloon pointing at the listener.  But due to interference between the tweeter and woofer, you have three speakers playing at once!  One at your ear and then one point up and another pointing down.Full spin data is enclosed.Informal Listening TestsMy first impression was positive, listening to what was mostly a balanced response.  In a few minutes though, I found the speaker bright a bit due to lack of deep bass.  I toed the speaker away from my ears and that made a drastic difference, balancing the tonality considerably.  Compared to my JBL LSR305P Mark II, the JBL had much better bass but otherwise had similar tonality which is to say the Pioneer was doing well.  Let me backtrack that a bit: there is a bit too much mid-range in the pioneer.On loudness test, deep lows play a bit but then the speaker falls apart drastically, getting super distorted.  Techno music with higher frequency bass was handled much better.  If you have an option of cutting out the very lows in your playback software, I would do that.ConclusionsI remember meeting Andrew Jones at CES years ago when he had first brought out these (or was it the older generation) ones.  I asked him what made them sound good and he said: ""people making budget speakers put in 10 cent parts.  I spend $1 and that makes a big difference!""   Naturally there is more there in the form of a skilled designer than typical budget speaker.Overall, the mission is accomplished in designing a speaker that is not offensive despite its low cost.  It looks good and seems to perform well.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.It is half hour before midnight as I am typing this review.

Make sure you are at or slightly above tweeter axis when listening:Impedance is around 5 ohm which is good for this day and age:Sorry, forgot to run the CSD/Waterfall test.Technics SB-F1 Speaker Listening TestsFirst impression with female vocals was very positive.  Sound was clean with just a hint of brightness.  Switching to tracks with more bass though degraded performance fair bit. At very low volumes, it was still very good.  But turn up the volume and there is a nasty resonance that is quite audible.  Turn it up more and the sound gets very muddy with distorted bass.  You could argue this is to be expected but I could not get past the resonance.FYI I could clearly hear the resonance in the frequency response sweep during testing at 96 dBSPL.ConclusionsI am impressed with level of engineering that went into the design of SB-F1.

Sound and Vision magazine had this to say after giving it 5 stars for performance:Stereophile dunk its beak into the water and had this to say:Always enjoyable?  We shall see about that as we get into measurements and listening tests.Measurements are performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics) to subtract room reflections. It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.  All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed.740 points were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) around the speaker resulting in less than 1% error across the full frequency spectrum.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Well, this is a bad way to start things.  There are so many problems here.  We have a suck out at 340 Hz.  Then various peaks and dips due to resonances.  By the way, a resonance is some part of the system singing at that range of frequencies when activated.  To the extent it is from the mechanic construction of the speaker, it makes for a horrible little speaker creating its own sound.  Depending on its phase, it may combine, subtract or something in between with the main sound playing by the drivers.  The moment they show up in this graph, it means they are loud enough to make an audible impact so are worrisome.Stepping back, instead of a flat on-axis/listening window response, we have all kinds of peaks and valleys.  Depending on what music you play, the accentuation may be a good thing (if a ton of distortion doesn't come for the ride) or more likely, not.Looking at predicted in-room response, we see that these sins are written all over the graph when you include the room reflections:None of these rough edges were apparently audible to our reviewers.Basic MeasurementsHere is our impedance and phase:Kinks in the phase/amplitude response as noted usually indicated resonances.  We saw the same problems in the spinorama though so there is no need to look for them here.Rated impedance of 6 ohm doesn't hold at 40 Hz where in my analysis has the peak response in music.  It is more like 4.5 ohms.Some of you love to see these CSD/waterfall measurements.  Here is one of countless views I can make up with this graph:Distortion data for a change shows useful information:What did Steve say?  Clear and clean with this much distortion in upper frequencies?Here is the ""in-room"" (in-garage) response:Note that the above is highly compressed graph so the frequency response looks much flatter than it is.Advanced Speaker MeasurementsAbove are some of the ugliest measurements I have seen so far.Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsOur Klippel NFS system reconstructs the full soundfield around the speaker down to whopping 1 degree of resolution.  Using that, we can get a 3-D picture of what is going on.  Let's look at the problem at 3.7 kHz:We see that both the tweeter and woofer singing strongly together so no wonder there are cancellations all around.We had a severe notch at 340 Hz.  Let's look at the response below, at and above 340 Hz:Dark color indicates loudest signal.  We can readily see that some kind of cancellation has sucked out the energy from the woofer at 340 Hz (middle image).Listening TestsI set up the measured speaker to the left of my monitor, elevated about 5 inches from the desk and tilted up and pointed toward my ear.  On the right side I had the Pioneer SP-B22-LR for comparison. The Dayton Audio B652-AIR sounded good for about 2 seconds until the piercing and distorted highs started to bother me.  They stood out because there is no upper bass.  There is lower bass that was vibrating my desk a bit but lack of upper base made them almost absent.  Female vocals were deadly with distorted lisping galore.  In sharp contrast, the Pioneer was warm, and far, far more balanced in response.Having been biased with the measurements, I thought I drag my poor wife up for a listen without telling here anything.  She immediately commented on the female vocals being annoying in the Dayton.  I forget her exact words but they were right on the money as far as what I observe with respect to shrill and distorted sound.  However, she liked the sound of some of the instruments that were brought out more by the Dayton.  Since she plays musical instruments, she focuses on them a lot more than I do.  I listen for overall balance but she seems to search for the individual strings and if she hears them, she likes that.ConclusionsThe Dayton Audio B652-AIR does everything wrong that you want to avoid in modern speaker design.  The woofer is run full bandwidth with no crossover meaning it sings along with the tweeter way above its linear frequency response.  The thin cabinet sings (easily audible in measurements) and combines with the woofer to create problems even in its target range.  The AMT tweeter has only a capacitor (single order filter) and resistor to tame it and clearly that is not enough.  All of this is due to the fact that a good crossover would cost far more than the individual components or even price of a full speaker!Does it sound better than a truly garbage speaker?  Yes.  But I am here to keep you from bad sound and this is bad sound folks.  Spend a few more dollars and get the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR.  Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Dayton Audio B652-AIR.  I have no idea how those reviewers have written what they have written.  Five star performance?  Are you kidding me?  Clear and clean with no obvious flaws?  Mr. Guttenberg, please get your ears trained and perform some comparative AB tests using single speakers.  This is embarrassing. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Hungry for some Chinese food.  Going to go out to get some.

It is on kind loan from a member who I think was the second person to send me a speaker.  The M22 is long discontinued.  It cost I think US $2,000 when new but I see it on used market for around US $600.  As such, it may make an alternative to buying something new now at $600 price point.The M22 enclosure is extremely solid and finished well:While the grill was a bit frayed, the rest of the speaker has endured the years very well, something that you may not be able to say about a vinyl wrapped budget speaker you buy today.The back panel shows not only the binding posts but also a set of useful controls (if you don't use electronic EQ):I measured the unit as seen.  For listening tests however, I also used the tweeter control (see later in this review).Love the fact that the binding posts are far apart, making it easy to screw and unscrew them.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 2.7 Hz. Over 700 measurement points were used to assure high precision in higher frequencies, resulting in well under 1% error. I am also using averaging to lower noise in bass frequencies. I also doubled the drive voltage (for spinorama) to overcome low frequency noise in my setting.All measurements are with no grill and on tweeter axis.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Well, you really have to squint to see any flaws.  On-axis response is quite flat as it should be.  And directivity (difference between direct sound coming at you and those reflected) is quite good as well.  There is a dip in low frequencies and when combined with the peaking at higher ones, it may make the speaker sound light.Predicted in-room response tells you that depending on where you draw the linear prediction line:Impedance is typical of small speakers with a difficult combination of 60 Hz phase shift around 100 Hz:This means the amplifier needs to be able to handle more current than it would otherwise.  Don't make the mistake of thinking a small speaker needs a small amplifier.  They rarely do.Distortion graph shows the typical low frequency peaks and some woofer struggle in the crossover region before it is retired:Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsAs usual with non-coaxial drivers, the vertical dispersion is not nearly as good as horizontal so absorption on the floor (rug) and ceiling is advised:Speaker Listening TestsI pluck down the Revel M22 on the same stand in my listening room I have used for other speaker tests.  Starting listening with just a single filter at 102 Hz or so to dial out a room mode.  First reaction was a clean sound that was a bit bright with little ""bottom end.""  With tons of power on tap, I could drive it hard with nary any distortion but the bass while present, was not making an impact.  This made vocals less exciting.  The highs were present and clean so not jarring but too much in the context of low bass response.So I resorted to dialing in a shelf boost in Roon player I was using:Credit to the nice woofer, while I could see it moving substantially back and forth now, distortion not present.  The sound was now warmer but still not quite there so I dialed in the treble two notches on the back of the speaker.  This made the overall experience much more positive.Knowing you all would ask, I swapped in the Elac DBR-62 speaker which I reviewed recently.  The subjective experience was definitely better with the Elac.  Warm, nice sound that was a delight.  I then put in the Revel M16.  Here, the M16 sounded cleaner but didn't quite have the bass that the Elac had.  It did sound a lot better than the M22 however.  Overall, the sound from M22 is screaming for a sub to supplement it where as with the more modern speakers (ELAC DBR-62 and Revel M16) you could easily live without.ConclusionsThe Revel M22 measures well and has low distortion, clean sound in a very sturdy cabinet.  The tonality however is too light for my taste to be used as is.  While new 2-way speakers try hard to replace a full sized speaker, the M22 seems to have set it sight on the classic bookshelf that produces just enough bass but not more.  Equalization helps and maybe that is enough for you.  It is not enough for me to recommend it over the Elac even though the build quality of Elac is substantially lower.I have a pair of even older Revel M20s that I use for our TV sound.  They are fine  for that purpose and hugely better than anything a soundbar can produce.  The M22s could work just as well in that application.Given the rather strong objective performance, I can recommend the Revel M22 but not wholeheartedly.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Got my paperwork together for my accountant to do our taxes.

It was kindly sent to me by a member for the review and costs US $229 per pair. If I did not tell you the price, you would think the S15 retails for $1000 given its very nice and ""high-end"" looks:And interesting cover an an inside out horn of some type adorns the rear port:There is a genius at work getting a budget speaker to look this interesting and differentiated from a massive crowd of budget speakers.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was enough to compute the sound field of the speaker within 1% to 2% error.Temperature was 81 degrees.

Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We would like on-axis response (in black) to be flat and smooth which it is not here.  We have peaking especially around 1 kHz and rising level in treble.  There is also directivity error meaning the woofer beam gets narrow before handing off sound duty to tweeter which has a wide beam at the same position (hence the dip in solid red line at the bottom).  This causes off-axis response to vary form on-axis making the speaker more room dependent.Early reflections -- if one excludes the directivity error -- is not bad:For a lot of speakers of this type it is best to have absorption on the floor (thick carpet) and high ceiling -- both of which I have in my room.  That helps reduce that directivity error.Combining everything we get this predicted response in our simulated room:How to draw that line is tricky but assuming you go with what I have done, speaker will likely be bright and have too much energy in lower midrange/upper bass (I use the terms interchangeably). Impedance is a low 3.7 ohm so be prepared to have good amplification that can tolerate such:The horizontal beamwidth shows the directivity error we talked about:The tweeter starts to ""beam"" (its response narrows) as frequencies get high.  So definitely not a textbook response we like to see (which would be horizontal red line).Same in 3-D heatmap:And vertical:Speaker Distortion MeasurementsComparing 86 and 96 dB SPL in room we get:It is common for bass distortion to heavily increase with level but those spikes between 500 and 1 kHz are excessive:Looking at driver components near-field we get:Seems like the disturbances in on-axis response are due to resonances from the port.There is some attempt to roll off the highs above 12 kHz or so.  This means if they wanted, they could have brought the level down earlier so likely they want the accentuated highs (to sell better in a showroom).I am leaving out the CSD/waterfall plot.Speaker Listening TestsI listened to S15 without looking at the measurements.  Immediate impression was accentuated upper bass which showed up in tubby electronic drums in the first track I played (I call anything in hundreds of hertz ""upper bass"").  In addition, there was brightness especially in female vocals.  This was with the speaker directed at my ears.  Having it toe out more helped a bit but not enough to get rid of brightness.I tried some EQ by trying to fill in the holes and that naturally did not work due to the problem being directivity error.  So I decided to pull the extra energy down instead:This worked well although the shelving filter is a poor choice here (you want a gradual rolling off filter which Roon does not have).  Once there, there was still a hint of brightness in female vocals which I did not like but otherwise, good improvement.Note that I find having too much energy around 1 kHz is better than not enough.  It creates some extra ""life"" there as opposed to recessing the tones in that important region. What was super impressive about this speaker is its bass response and ability to play loud.  Despite using just one speaker, the S15 had no problem with my super low bass track.  I could turn it up without the woofer bottoming out to exceedingly loud level!  I don't think I have had a speaker this size at any price play bass so well!ConclusionsI must confess I expected a mess when I went into this review given the aggressive retail focus Polk has.  Perhaps it was based on that expectation that I did not find the measurements defects as bad as I would normally assume.  Subjectively even without EQ, the very nice bass response creates a nice experience.   The exaggerated highs did get to me so it is not a speaker I would buy.  But I can see the appeal of it when combined with bass response.Given the incredible looks and build quality, combined with speaker's amazing bass reproduction, I am going to marginally put the Polk Audio Signature S15 on my recommended list.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The panthers want to have a pool party before the summer ends.

Despite the ""monitor"" designation, this is a passive speaker needing external amplification.  I purchased this unit back in January for US $70 (single unit).  Company list price is US $149 but is on sale now for $125 (again, each).This is a very compact and rather dense speaker:The back panel shows lack of any kind of port:The finish is nice and glossy but the corners are very sharp which is not easy on the hand or measurements likely.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:The most glaring issue he is lack of bass response which is due to lack of port and tiny enclosure.  Second issue related to same factors is very low sensitivity.  Third is poor directivity due to lack of any mechanism to get the beamwidth of the tweeter and woofer to match at crossover point:The blue arrow shows the classic response of a tweeter (or any driver) as wavelengths get smaller.  The tweeter gets progressively more directional.  Same is happening to the woofer so we get a mismatch around 4 to 5 kHz.  This then translates into our off-axis response being uneven and not match the direct sound:Result is a response with a dip in critical range of music:Combine that with lack of bass and this speaker will likely not sound good.Directivity plots show what we have seen already:Distortion story naturally is not good:Finally here is our impedance and phase:EDIT: forgot the drive response:NHT Super Zero 2.1 Speaker Listening TestsI hooked up the 2.1 to my main system placed on top of a stand for standard far-field listening.  The sound was dead on multiple fronts: there was no volume making me crank my powerful amplifier to ungodly levels.   Then there was no bass and I mean no bass.  The moment the music would rely on bass notes to carry on, the sound level would go way down.  Ditto for anything in 2 to 3 kHz range.  A 3 dB boost in that region gave the speaker some lift but really, I was so unhappy with the experience that I shut everything off and that was all she told.ConclusionsAmazing that a company like NHT that had a great reputation in the 1990s into 2000s has fallen by the wayside so much.  There is nothing in this design that follows what we know listeners want: bass, even response, even directivity. And oh, some efficiency would be good too as I doubt someone wants to save money on a speaker and then wants to spend more to buy a powerful amplifier/receiver to drive it.Very disappointing.  Needless to say, I can't recommend the NHT Super Zero 2.1.

Grill was not used.Teac S-300HR MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Gosh, this looks pretty poor.  Bass output is low at just 81 to 82 dB.  Response then gradually rises with multiple peaks indicating resonances.  The only positive is that until you get to 8 kHz, resonances repeat in early window and sound power which means you should be able to EQ them down.  Then again, you will have a very inefficient speaker when you do that.Looking at the driver responses we see signs of the same resonances:We can see them in the impedance curves as well:I was surprised how much smoother early window reflection sum was:This as such moderates our predicted in-room response:So outside of bass, we really have a coupe of problem areas, one around 900 Hz to 1.5 kHz and anther peak around 4.5 kHz. The beam width is variable due to woofer beaming (narrowing):Looks a bit better in this view:Benefit of coaxial design easily comes to light in the vertical directivity which is better than any traditional 2-way speaker:I have a carpet on the floor and tall ceiling though so won't be doing me a lot of good.Here is our center frequency 3-D horizontal Directivity Baloon:We get a bit wiggly around 2 kHz but in grand scheme of things, it is decent and very nice by 3 kHz.  Again, the coaxial design helps here.Had a request in the last review to show three steps for distortion starting at 76 dBSPL.  To whoever suggested that, I hate you I can't figure out a good way to show it without it taking up so much space!  Here is the relative distortion:Clearly our little woofer is getting upset but the tweeter is sailing along.Teac S-300HR Listening TestsFirst impression wasn't bad.  There was some of that ""showroom sound"" with heightened detail and some brightness. I brought out the EQ tools and tried to use the on-axis response to correct the resonances.  While I got rid of the brightness, subjectively I still did not like the sound as it had gotten too dull.  As I was writing the review I realized why: I should have used the predicted in-room response and corrected less.  90% of the time I find on-axis correction works best but this the 10% that works better with PIR.Even with that EQ though, the main problem here is lack of bass.  It is very muted so lets the rest of the spectrum stand out too much.  I have a minimum standard that even a bookshelf speaker should provide satisfying response without the need for a sub.  This speaker doesn't get there.I should note that the woofer is graceful in handling volume, likely because it is not working too hard.FYI the entire cabinet resonates with every bit of music.  I am used to feeling something with bass notes and such in speakers.  But here, the cabinet is acting like a musical instrument, vibrating consistently and all the time.  Up close I thought I heard it contribute a ""zingy"" overtone to the speaker.  Yes, that is a technical term!ConclusionsThe Teac S-300HR is gorgeously built.  Alas, that doesn't extend to the objective performance.  On-axis response is a mess with many resonances.  Coaxial nature brings some value but I am not sure they are important things.  Subjectively without sufficient bass, you are just going to be frustrated with the sound even if you EQ it as there is not enough headroom here to push the speaker.Overall, I can't recommend the Teac S-300HR but do appreciate some aspects of it.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Seems like good attempt was made to create a flat on-axis response.  We do have some droop above 300 Hz though.  And there is a pronounced resonance around 2.5 kHz as indicated.  In the same region, we see the directivity become much wider showing a mismatch between the beam pattern of the woofer and tweeter.  This causes a broad dip in off-axis response:Impacting the predicted in-room response:Still, not too bad.Looking at near-field response of the drivers we see that the woofer response is to blame for the off-axis response errors:As mentioned, there is directivity mismatch between the woofer and tweeter:Fixing that would have required narrower beamwidth through use of a larger waveguide for the tweeter.Vertical directivity is usually not great in 2-way speakers but here is more acute:So make sure to point the tweeter axis at your ear.  Otherwise you will have even a larger hole in response around 2 kHz.Distortion is well controlled in bass but there is some error around crossover (I am guessing it is the woofer):Impedance measurement shows some resonances as usual and minimum impedance which is slightly above average:For fans of timing measurements, here are the waterfall, impulse and step responses:Monitor Audio Silver 100 Speaker Listening Tests and EqualizationThe first impression was of slight brightness.  But otherwise not too bad.  My chops were busted when I tried to develop an EQ for it though.  I must have spent an hour creating various filters and abandoning them because they did not in balance improve the sound across multiple music tracks.  Eventually, I landed on this simple set of two filters:It was developed by following the predicted in-room response.  I don't have huge confidence in it though but thought I share it.I found the sound with EQ in place to be spatially large, likely due to wide dispersion of the tweeter.  I swapped the Revel M16 in its place and it definitely had a smaller halo around it (but also did not sound bright).ConclusionsThe Silver 100 looks gorgeous and seems to have good engineering behind it to create a good response.  It does however have a few small scale flaws.  Because their scale was small, it was hard to evaluate their impact and develop correction for it.  All else being equal, I rather see a speaker with larger error that are easy to identify and fix.    Such was not the case here.  I let you judge its performance then based on data you see as my subjective assessment is weak in this regard.I am going to give a recommendation to Monitor Audio Silver 100 with the bit of EQ in place.  Hopefully we can get our hands on the ""G7"" version to see if they have made any refinements that mitigate the issues I found.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $999 for a pair.The bamboo version I have is machined so well that the corners are almost knife sharp!  Magnetic grill is a nice touch but for testing, I removed it as you see.  Not much to the back panel as to show that it is a sealed design:Seems like the company name used to be Vera-Fi.If you are new to my testing, please watch this tutorial on understanding speaker measurements. XSA Labs Vanguard Speaker MeasurementsLet's start with our usual anechoic frequency response measurements created by Klippel Near-field Scanner:Well, this is not what we want to see!  We have massive and broad peaking of the response from about 700 to 3 kHz and a couple of notches.  There seems to be no attempt at creating a neutral response.  Sensitivity drops to  a very low 80 dB or even lower at some frequencies.  Company post a DIY style measurement in a forum showing something different:While their is also pretty bad it shows that using the wrong protocol for testing can hide actual design issues.Simple near-field driver measurements show the core problem:Notice the wide overlap between the tweeter and woofer.  The two add up to create the ""hill"" we see in the anechoic frequency response measurement.The mid-woofer is close enough in size to the tweeter which makes for decent directivity.  That makes it easier to EQ but without, it causes off-axis to be just as bad as on-axis:This makes predicted-in-room response decidedly poor:Allowing the woofer to play too high seems to be the reason for higher distortion in that region:Digging into directivity again, we see confirmation of what I stated above:If we didn't have that notch between 4 and 5 kHz, this would have been a pretty good response.  For that reason though, you better toe in the speaker toward you:Vertically we have to stay at tweeter axis as is typically the case with 2-way traditional designs like this:Company spec of 8 ohm impedance seems right for the lowest it gets:Finally, here is our waterfall and step responses:XSA Labs Vanguard Listening Tests and EqualizationI usually start with my female vocals but this time, I had one of my bass tracks queued up so hit play on that. I was surprised how little volume I was getting out of the speaker even after I cranked it way up (I have a 400 watt Mark Levinson amplifier driving it). I stopped and switched to my regular female vocal and volume shot way up.  The sound was inoffensive and one could think this is good sound (if you didn't play anything with bass in it).  Recalling the poor frequency response measurements, I brought out the EQ and first filter I dialed in was for the broad excess energy in lower treble:That pulled the female vocals back, restoring a neutral response although I could see someone just listening to female vocals liking the stock sound maybe better.  To my ears, there was not much warmth so I pulled up the response in upper bass as measurements showed. That was nice but then I had some boominess on a track.  I have a room mode around 105 Hz and that is where this speaker peaks as well so I pulled that down some.  Now the sound was much more balanced but still not to my liking.  Many of my reference tracks didn't sound good.I remembered that in the past I have had good luck in getting more bass out of sealed cabinets by pulling up the bass response a bit.  If the drivers handle it without getting distortion, the effect is like having a port but without its drawback of transmitting cabinet resonances.  Indeed that was the case here with that 70 Hz filter.  For the first time, I could actually get some physical sensation of bass out of the floor.With all of these filters in place, the sound was good enough for about half of my tracks.  Distortion was not audible unless I really pushed the speaker where it started to creating some ticking sounds.  It was plenty loud just playing one speaker so I think you will be fine with a pair.ConclusionsCompany website is high on review quotes and low on information.  But reading around it seems that the company thinks they have designed something akin to BBC LS3/5A (???).  Whatever the aim was, it is a complete miss in practice.  They need to up their game in measurements and spend more time performing proper AB testing using other speakers blind, or as i do, with electronic EQ.  Just listening to one speaker, especially one's own design, is likely to lead you into a ditch and that is precisely what we have.  So while I appreciate the woodworking here, the speaker itself is a miss on grounds of simple principles of designing a neutral speaker that appeals to many audiophiles.Fortunately the rather similar sizes of the drivers makes directivity decent enough that simple EQ filtering makes a dramatic difference.I cannot recommend the XSA Labs Vanguard speaker.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $70 a pair plus $8 shipping on Amazon.  Note that this is the revised version of MK402 (hence the letter ""X"" after its model number).From the front, MK402X looks to be a more expensive speaker than it is with chamfered edges and such:The back gives out the budget look though:Still, not too bad at all for what you are paying here.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of around 1%.Testing temperature was around 65 degrees F.Reference axis for measurements was the center of the tweeter (by eye).Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Dayton MK402X MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Apparently the older version had a peaking tweeter and in this revision, it was brought down.  That is a good thing given the broad dip proceeding it.  This is not a bad response though.  Beyond that dip we just have a resonance around 5 and 6 kHz.  There is good bit of bass despite the little driver in there.  Sensitivity is very low though as noted so you need good bit of amplification.Good directivity results in similar early window and predicted in-room response:Near-field driver measurements shows the reason behind the broad dip:Seems like there is a slow roll off filter on the woofer, or a high order one on tweeter causing the two to not quite meet in the middle as far as level.Port resonances are kept low which is nice.I only dared to test the distortion at 86 dB SPL as it required ton of power to just to get to this level:Horizontal Beamwidth is constant and broad for the most part which is good:You have 10 to 20 degree leeway vertically as far as placement of the tweeter relative to your ears which is good:Impedance drops to 4 ohm around 200 Hz:Dayton MK402X Listening TestsOther than needing a lot of power to get loud, out of box experience was fine.  Really, it was fine which is not what one expects in this price range with so many compromises.  I dialed in a broad EQ to fix the dip, pulled down the resonance between 5 and 6 kHz and the sound improved good bit to real hi-fi level:There was enough bass to activate the one room mode in my room at 105 Hz to put in that filter.  Half the time it was needed, half the time not.  It reduced bass but also some high frequency harshness due to distortion harmonics.  So you would want to play with that in your room.The rear port makes noises that were audible around 2 feet and closer.  So be careful in near-field listening.  My tests were in far-field.ConclusionThe expectation going into a review like this is that speaker is going to be junk unless proven otherwise.  Well, it was proven otherwise!  Somehow the designer managed to deal with the compromises just right to create a speaker that produces a very good experience with equalization.  And not bad without.Overall, I am going to recommend the Dayton MK402X.  If you need a pair of speakers that can excite you with well recorded music most of the time and not cost more than a dinner, you have found it.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150"

There is additional information there that I am not including here.  I am just covering the highlights here.  If you want more details look at the review page here: https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/loudspeakers/neumi_bs5/IntroI stumbled on talk of the Neumi BS5 speaker recently in the context of a potential high-value speaker. Out of curiosity, I went to the product page on Amazon to check them out and liked what I saw. I then pulled up the Neumi’s BS5 manual here is the link where I saw placement recommendations, and some other bits of information which all gave me the impression the manufacturer cares about how the user listens to their product rather than the old “sink or swim” attitude low-cost products leave you with. Generally, when this information is laid out for the user it also implies the product is worthwhile. At least, that’s the impression I am left with in those cases.At any rate, Amazon had them listed for $90/pair (at the time of purchase) and I figured they were worth buying to review and pass the information on to the audio community so you all could either avoid them or feel comfortable spending your hard earned money on. So, I did.Ultimately, while these aren’t the best performing speakers I’ve tested or heard, I do believe these provide a good value to the budget-limited audiophile. And, with a few engineering alterations, could be made into an even better value. Read on for more detail.Product Specs and PhotosImpedance Phase and Magnitude:Impedance measurements are provided both at 0.10 volts RMS and 2.83 volts RMS. The low-level voltage version is standard because it ensures the speaker/driver is in linear operating range. The higher voltage is to see what happens when the output voltage is increased to the 2.83vRMS speaker sensitivity test.Frequency Response:The measurement below provides the frequency response at the reference measurement axis - also known as the 0-degree axis or “on axis” plane - in this measurement condition was situated in-between with the woofer and the tweeter per the product manual. While the manual does do a good job of directing the user how to set up the speakers, I emailed Neumi to ask about listening angle and the grille use. I wanted to make sure I used the speakers the way they were designed to be used. Below is our email exchange:I purchased your BS5 bookshelf speakers and was wondering:  Are these designed to be listened to on-axis (with the speaker aimed directly toward the listener) or at some angle off-axis? I assume the former. Are these designed to be listened to with the grilles on or off? I assume off, as most speakers perform worse with the grilles on. Thank you.Click to expand...Hi Erin, Thank you for your inquiry! The BS5 are designed to be listened to pointed straight forwards. If you like to have a slightly brighter response, you can point the speakers more towards the center position. We also tuned the BS5 without a grill. The grill was made afterwards to minimize its effect on the speaker output. It is fairly transparent but does change the response slightly.Click to expand...​If the speakers are to be aimed facing forward, that would be approximately 30-degrees off-axis in my room. I can toe them in or out if you recommend using a different positioning angle than this.Click to expand...​Hi Erin, Thanks for the additional information. I would start out pointing straight, then try it with 10-15 degree toe-in and see how that sounds to you, more than that, the toe-in would be pretty extreme and is not recommended.Click to expand...So, per Neumi’s direction I listened to the speakers both on-axis (0°) and off-axis (≤30°) horizontally. I found the best angle to be directly on-axis. Otherwise, the treble was too subdued. When it came time to measure the speaker, I verified that 0° gave the most linear response and conducted the rest of my analysis with the reference axis being at 0° horizontally and between the mid/tweeter vertically.Also, per Neumi’s direction, the grille was off for these measurements. I do have comparison data of the grille on vs off in my Miscellaneous section below.CEA-2034 (aka: Spinorama):What we can learn from this data is that this speaker has significant directivity problems thanks to the deep nulls at ~800Hz and ~1600Hz. You can see it in the above spectrogram and globe plots as well as in all the measurements in the above graphic. The crossover is stated as 2.1kHz by Neumi and the nearfield data backs this up. Therefore, in this region you can see the directivity mismatch. Looking at 1kHz you see a rising DI until approximately 2.5kHz where the Early Reflections DI dips back down again. This is a sign the transition from mid to tweeter is occurring as the woofer is beginning to beam (radiate more forward than omnidirectional) and the tweeter is taking over, omnidirectional until approximately 6.5kHz (calculated based on dome size of 1 inch). The DI flattens out a bit through here but as the tweeter begins to radiate more directionally the DI increases again above ~7kHz. The tweeter rolls off sharply above 16kHz, causing directivity to increase further. What does this all mean to you? Well, mismatches in what is coming directly at you, on-axis, vs what is reflected around you can cause issues in stage and tonality cues.Below is a breakout of the typical room’s Early Reflections contributors (floor bounce, ceiling, rear wall, front wall and side wall reflections). From this you can determine how much absorption you need and where to place it to help remedy strong dips from the reflection(s). Notice the strong dips again at 800Hz and 1600Hz.Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Compression:Using the 93dB measurement tells you the measured low-frequency distortion at about 80Hz is near 3% THD and 6% at 40Hz. Will you hear that? Pure distortion is more subjective and depends not just on the listener but also no the program material.I typically use distortion to tell me where mechanical failures are because the distortion I hear is typically either a rattle, buzz, plop from a woofer extending too far, or something along those lines. The bass is usually the problem. But in this speaker the midrange exhibits distortion at higher output levels and was also audible in my listening (primarily with male vocals).The compression effects shown in the image below are a visual way of seeing just what happens as the volume is increased. This one is straight-forward. Take the legend’s SPL value and add or subtract the data from the graphic. This tells you if you’re losing or gaining output (yes, you can gain output from compression; as un-intuitive as that seems). Mostly, the compression results in a loss due to temperature increase in the voice coil of the drive unit. Let’s look at a specific example. Take the 90dB at 4 meters target listening volume provided above. Again, you need 93dB’s (7.62vRMS) data. At that volume, the highest amount of compression measured is about 1dB at 40Hz and about 0.25dB at 50Hz, decreasing until about 200Hz. At some points the speaker suffered >2dB compression at 40Hz with 14vRMS. Overall, the compression results tell you what common sense would tell you: don’t try to use this speaker in place of a subwoofer at anything other than lower volumes. Otherwise, at louder listening volumes you lose over 1dB of output. And it is audibly present as a very grainy and “limited” sound; there are no dynamics at this output and that’s exactly what I heard in my listening tests when I pushed the speaker to uncomfortable levels.Extra Measurements:These are just some extra sets of measurements I completed. Some, I didn’t process through my MATLAB scripts so they’re kind of raw. But I know some would like to see them so here you go.Grille on vs Grille off at 0° and 45°.The grille on case results in an increase in comb filtering (higher amplitude peaks/dips). Leave the grille off.Accelerometer Cabinet Resonance Test.I used an accelerometer. I attached the accelerometer to the side (top, middle, bottom), back and front of the cabinet and fed a 2.83vRMS signal through the speaker.I have overlaid all these results against the on-axis response as well. Note, however, the accelerometer is NOT calibrated for level and therefore is only intended to show relative changes. What you look for in this data is large peaks that would indicate a resonance. I’m seeing a lot of mountains and molehills, but I don’t think this data is conclusive enough to do anything other than make a mountain out of a molehill. Others may disagree.Since the accelerometer is not calibrated for voltage in the above graphic, I chose instead to view the results via a Sonograph, shown below. This shows a long decay for 800Hz - 900Hz. This seems to line up with a resonance of the ports, shown in the next section.Nearfield measurements.Mic placed about 0.50 inches from each drive unit and port. While I tried to make these as accurate in SPL as I could, I cannot guarantee the relative levels are absolutely correct so I caution you to use this data as a guide but not representative of actual levels (measuring in the nearfield makes this hard as a couple millimeters’ difference between measurements can alter the SPL level). Got it? Good.There are a few noteworthy things here:Port resonance is very, very strong and clearly contributes to the on-axis response dips at ~800Hz and ~1600Hz.The area between 300Hz to 700Hz (just before the 800Hz dip) is elevated slightly. This area also lines up with the increased THD levels I discussed earlier. This could be coincidence. But I believe they are related. Maybe the port is having more of an effect in this region than it needs to?Woofer break-up contributes to a few on-axis resonances we see. Particularly, 4.5kHz.There are other things going on here but I don’t have the time to reverse engineer this speaker. Not that I could.Step-Response.One not zoomed and one zoomed.Plugging the port (making the speaker sealed).To test whether the ports were, indeed, the culprit of the deep nulls I took my socks off and plugged the ports. Don’t worry, I had only been wearing the socks for 3 days. Sure enough, plugging the ports filled in the nulls. But it also decreased the low frequency output by about 2dB below 300Hz.Objective Evaluation:Much of what I am about to say I have already touched on under the data. But to recap:Impedance:Minimum load of about 4.6 Ohms. But mostly > 6 Ohms. Check your receiver or amplifier’s spec to make sure it can drive a 6 Ohm load without issue.Wiggles around 200Hz and 280Hz indicate resonance which also shows up in frequency response.Frequency Response/Spectrograms/Globes/Spinorama:I measured an average of 84.2dB @ 2.83v/1m.I measured a ±3dB response from 64Hz - 20kHz but only if you ignore the dip in response around 800Hz. Neumi claims a ±3dB window of 50Hz - 20kHz (typical in-room). Buy a subwoofer if you want to listen loud and low.Numerous resonances; most caused by the port. Woofer breakup shows up in a few places as well.Directivity shifts caused by inadequate crossover order and resonances from the ports and woofer.Distortion/Compression:High distortion at 40Hz but understandable given woofer size.High levels of compression at high output below 100Hz.Elevated midrange distortion (audible at higher volumes).These are both audible effects when listening full-range as I did.Don’t expect much bass below 80Hz out of these speakers. Buy a subwoofer for that.If more time/money were spent on taming the resonances and break-up modes I think this speaker could be markedly improved. But, for $90, you kind of expect these things. Namely because higher order crossovers are not cheap and take up real-estate.Subjective Evaluation:Subjective Analysis Setup:The speaker was aimed on-axis with the tweeter at ear level.I used Room EQ Wizard (REW) and my calibrated MiniDSP UMIK-1 to get the volume on my AVR relative to what the actual measured SPL was in the MLP (~11 feet from the speakers). I varied it between 85-90dB, occasionally going up to the mid 90’s to see what the output capability was. In a poll I found most listen to music in this range. Realistically, 90dB is loud for long-term listening volume and I find most overestimate their listening volume until an SPL microphone is used to determine the actual level.All speakers are provided a relatively high level of Pseudo Pink-Noise for a day or two - with breaks in between - in order to calm any “break-in” concerns.I demoed these speakers without a crossover and without EQ.I listened to these speakers and made my subjective notes before I started measuring objectively. I did not want my knowledge of the measurements to influence my subjective opinion. This is important because I want to try to correlate the objective data with what I hear in my listening space in order to determine the validity of the measurement process. I try to do a few listening sessions over a couple days so I can give my ears a break and come back “fresh”. I also want to be as transparent to you as I can be so below are my subjective evaluations made before I began any measurements.Here’s the rundown of my subjective notes (in quotes) and where it fits with objective:Overall, I found the max SPL I could drive the speakers to was around 90-92dB at my listening position, depending on the music. That’s loud. But once I got past this point the compression was very audible and all the dynamics went away. This was most evident on the opening bass notes of Lauryn Hill’s song. It was very evident that I had reached the “brick wall” output here, even though the woofers weren’t mechanically falling apart like I would have expected.In my listening tests the main thing that stood out to me was the high-frequency balance being off. In some cases it sounded about 1-3dB too low. In a few cases I heard some ‘sizzle’ on instruments that I do not believe are correct (I didn’t make the album; I can’t know for sure). The data tends to agree with that in relation to the rest of the spectrum. There are some hot spots here and there discussed previously.I felt room ambiance was lacking in some recordings. For example, I noted this in “Higher Love”.I made a few notes about resonance in lower vocals and questioned if I could “hear cabinet ringing”. I noticed this primarily in “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” and “Tell Yer Mama”.I noted midrange distortion at ~ 90dB (at 11 feet) in both Jim Croce’s and John Mayer’s tracks. I wasn’t sure what this was when I listened the first time, but the data clearly shows an increased level of distortion smack in the middle of the midrange. I went back through a final round of listening after I saw the data and on the “He Mele No Lilo” track, at the end, I could hear distortion in the singer’s voice. It seems I noticed this distortion in male vocals.I noted some things that I hadn’t heard or wasn’t used to hearing with other speakers. For example, Chaka Khan’s voice as background singer in Steve Winwood’s “Higher Love” was more present. I don’t know what to attribute this to… is it a distortion in the midrange? Is it the breakup from the midwoofer at higher frequencies? Is it a relative thing; the dips at ~800Hz and ~1600Hz causing other areas to be more noticeable than a more flat speaker?The bass was punchy; the harmonics of kickdrums and synth sounded good. But there was no weight to those because the speaker just doesn’t play that well below about 100Hz.The stage width was a weird one. In some songs it didn’t seem wider than 10° outside the speakers (so, about 40° total) where with other songs it was wider than this. Each recording is different, and you do want a stereo system that expands and contracts proportionately with the music. But I believe the variance in this case is more attributable to the directivity changes caused by the crossover and resonances.I also turned the speakers to be about 10 to 30° off-axis to see if I could get rid of the harsh treble. That didn’t help much at all and when you view the data you can see the off-axis response has low directivity around 4kHz (meaning, the sound is more omnidirectional at this frequency) which indicates the bright 4kHz region would be noticeable through a wider region of angles. I believe this explains the “biting” noise I was hearing as well.I didn't have a chance to run Dirac Live so I can't speak to what the sound would be post room correction.Bottom LineThis speaker doesn’t measure perfectly. And, for the most part, I was able to match areas of concern between my subjective listening session and my measurements. Though, I didn’t have any significant gripes about the sound. The one main dislike for me was the reduced treble compared to the midrange. The bass is pretty well blended to the midrange despite the moderate bump in response around 100Hz. There is not much output below this at higher levels, but I can forgive the shortcomings in the bass department because the BS5 isn’t trying to pretend that it can play like a subwoofer. I have seen other 5-inch woofers with higher linear excursion than what these woofers are seemingly capable of but just one of those drive-units alone costs more than this pair of speakers. The midrange distortion is an issue if you’re going to listen at high levels; for me being at 90dB at 11 feet (which is about 93dB at 8 feet per this awesome calculator). These aren’t reference level speakers. But I think anyone buying them understands the implicit output limitations. Under 90dB at 11 feet, the sound is more balanced and undistorted.Personally, I think these speakers would be better suited as desktop/computer speakers sealed (stuff the ports) and against a wall. The wall would give you a +6dB increase on the lower end to help make up for the plugged ports but plugging the ports would get rid of the nasty resonances that plague this speaker. I would not place these in a corner in a small room, though. Doing so creates a combing effect you do not want. Alternatively, you can use these as small satellite speakers for a budget-minded home theater. However, if you want ultimate hi-fidelity at reference levels on a shoestring budget then these speakers are not it. The frequency response deviations and distortion keep it from that goal. But, when used within reasonable limits, this is a “fun” little speaker that is enjoyable and a great entry into the hi-fi realm at $90/pair. I hate using the “but it’s cheap” argument but, really, this is a $90 pair of bookshelf speakers. More than that, though, there’s no marketing language by Neumi to suggest they are the best speakers ever. Nothing that overstates their capabilities that I have seen. I think Neumi had a target in mind with this price and performance and I believe they hit it.I’m going to plug my Amazon affiliate link one last time just in case you want to buy these.

You can find the manufacturer’s information here but I have provided some snippets below:Design: 6.5” 2-wayDrivers: Purifi woofer and BZ Labs CQ76B ribbon/planar tweeter.Frequency Response: (+1/-3dB) 40hz-20KBass Extension: -10dB @ 33hzImpedance: 5 ohms/nominal, 4.2 ohms/minimumSensitivity: 84.5dB /1W/1MSuggested Power: 30-100 watts/channel RMSDimensions: 15.5”(H) x 8.5”(W) x 11”(D)Weight: 25 lbs.Standard Finishes: Walnut,Cherry,Maple, and Oak (other veneers available for quote upon request)Pricing: $2,895/pair (includes free shipping to the mainland USA)Rick emailed me some additional information he wanted to note:There are no grills but the front does have embedded magnets for them. I always supply fabric grills so you can mention that in your review. I omitted them with this pair since I mainly built them to be reviewed and for local demos. The grills of course could be added later on if I sell them.This pair has an oil finish that’s very matte and more in vogue these days with the modern rustic interiors. The surface isn’t ultra smooth but can be buffed out more if needed - again, more in part to the rustic look. The front baffle is Sycamore veneer and sides reconstituted Wenge veneer. The cost for this pair is $2,895 and this includes shipping to the mainland USA. The cost range is $2,695 - $2,895 depending on the veneer used. We can also finish them with a medium gloss conversion varnish if someone wants more sheen than this pair exhibits.The design axis is the center of the tweeter. A typical stand height is 24”-28”.As an aside, I have also tested the Purifi Drive Unit from this speaker. You can find that full review here: https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/driveunits/purifi_ptt65w04/.Objective DataUnless otherwise noted, all the data below was captured using Klippel Distortion Analyzer 2 and Klippel modules (TRF, DIS, LPM, ISC to name a few). Most of the data was exported to a text file and then graphed using my own MATLAB scripts in order to present the data in a specific way I prefer. However, some is given using Klippel’s graphing.Foreword: Subjective Analysis vs Objective Data (click for more)Impedance Phase and Magnitude:Impedance measurements are provided both at 0.10 volts RMS and 2.83 volts RMS. The low-level voltage version is standard because it ensures the speaker/driver is in linear operating range. The higher voltage is to see what happens when the output voltage is increased to the 2.83vRMS speaker sensitivity test.From the above data we can see the following:The tuning frequency of the enclosure is approximately 35Hz.The minimum impedance dips to about 4.7 Ohms around 1.4kHz with a nominal impedance at 5 Ohms. A separate amplifier from the typical AVR would be needed to drive this speaker to typical playback volumes.There are no signs of resonance (typically visible as bumps/wiggles in the impedance that deviate from the curve).Frequency Response:Notes about measurements (click for info)The measurement below provides the frequency response at the reference measurement axis - also known as the 0-degree axis or “on axis” plane - in this measurement condition was situated at the ribbon.The mean SPL, approximately 85dB at 2.83v/1m, is calculated over the frequency range of 300Hz to 3,000Hz.The blue shaded area represents the ±3dB response window from my calculated mean SPL value. As you can see in the blue window above, the Selah Audio Purezza has a ±3dB response from 65Hz - 20kHz. Even better, a tighter window of linearity is provided in gray as ±1.5dB from the mean SPL and this speaker stays within this window from about 200Hz all the way to 20kHz (ignoring the 0.5dB around 3.7kHz). That is impressive!The speaker’s F3 point (the frequency at which the response has fallen 3dB relative to the mean SPL) is 65Hz and the F10 (the frequency at which the response has fallen by 10dB relative to the mean SPL) is 34Hz. This speaker has nice low frequency extension.You will most likely be drawn the low-frequency trim below ~300Hz, showing about 2.5dB drop from 300Hz to 100Hz. I asked Rick about this and this was his reply:The amount of baffle step compensation was determined from how I thought most users would place the speaker (in close proximity to the rear wall). I could easily change the BSC if someone places it far out into the room and / or wants it voiced differently. There’s always the tradeoff of output capability / sensitivity in the midband and I wanted to keep the sensitivity more reasonable. The tuning is also slightly overdamped which contributes to what you measured as well.Click to expand...So, Rick can adjust this amount of trim or you can use a DSP shelf-filter to boost this back up. Personally, in my initial listening tests I actually really, really liked the bass.  But I wound up employing DSP to boost the LF to get it to a more accurate setting.  I will discuss this more in the subjective evaluation below and give some of my thoughts on this.Another thing that stood out to me was the lack of midrange resonance I measured in Buchardt's S400 speaker and that I believe I have seen in other speakers using a passive radiator in the rear.Below are both the horizontal and vertical response over a limited window (90° horizontal, ±40° vertical). I have provided a “normalized” set of data as well. The normalization simply means that I took the difference of the on-axis response and compared the other axes’ measurements to the on-axis response which gives the viewer a good idea of the speaker performance, relative to the on-axis response, as you move off-axis.As I said above, the provided frequency response graphs were given with a limited set of data. I measured the response of the speaker’s vertical and horizontal axis in 10-degree steps over 360-degrees. Nearly 70 measurements in total are represented in my data. As you can imagine, providing all those data points in a single FR-type graphic below is a bit overwhelming and confusing for the viewer. A spectrogram is an alternate way to view this full set of data. This takes a 360-degree set of data and “collapses” it down to a rectangular representation of the various angles’ SPL. I have provided two sets of data: one set for horizontal and one for vertical. Each set consists of 2 graphics:Full response (20Hz - 20kHz with the angles from 0° to ±180°) with absolute SPL valuesFull, “normalized” response (20Hz - 20kHz with the angles from 0° to ±180°) with SPL values relative to the 0-degree axisNormalized plots make it easier to compare how the speaker’s off-axis response behaves relative to the on-axis response curve.The above spectrograms are the standard way of providing directivity graphics by most reviewers. Some prefer not to normalize the data. Some prefer to normalize the data. Either way, it’s a useful visual to get an idea of the directivity characteristics of a speaker or driver.However, these “collapsed” representations of the sound field are not very intuitively viewed. At least not to me. So, I came up with a different way to view the speaker’s horizontal and vertical sound field by providing it across a 360° range in a globe plot below. I have provided both an absolute SPL version as well as a normalized version of both the horizontal and vertical sound fields.Note the legend provided in the top left of each image which helps you understand speaker orientation provided in my global plots below.CEA-2034 (aka: Spinorama):The following set of data is populated via 360-degree, 10° stepped, “spins” from vertical and horizontal planes resulting in 70 unique measurements. Thus, this is sometimes referred to as “Spinorama” data. Audioholics has a great writeup on what these data mean (link here) and there is no sense in me trying to re-invent the wheel so I will reference you to them for further discussion. However, I will explain these curves lightly and provide my own spin on what they mean (pun totally intended). Sausalito Audio also has a good write-up on these curves here. Furthermore, you can find discussion in Dr. Floyd Toole’s book “Sound Reproduction”. And, finally, here is a great video of Dr. Toole discussing the use of measurements to quantify in-room performance.In short, the CEA-2034 graphic below takes all the response measurements (horizontal and vertical) and applies weighting and averaging to sub-sets and can help provide an (accurate) prediction of the response in a typical room. If there is a single set of data to use in your purchase decision, this is probably it.Alternatively, click this arrow, if you want my quick take on what these curves mean without going to another site.Below is a breakout of the typical room’s Early Reflections contributors (floor bounce, ceiling, rear wall, front wall and side wall reflections). From this you can determine how much absorption you need and where to place it to help remedy strong dips from the reflection(s). Again, as a pointer to the wide horizontal envelope, notice how the Rear Wall Bounces Curve is relatively high in amplitude (for a front-facing tweeter, at least) until about 10kHz.And below is the Predicted In-Room response compared to a general Target curve equaling -1dB/octave.The placement of the target curve’s starting point at 200Hz (which is my standard) combined with the previously discussed low-frequency trim of 2.5dB, makes the difference between the target curve and predicted in-room response more apparent than I suspect would actually be. So, I have also provided another version of this image below, using 300Hz as the starting point.You may ask just how useful the above prediction is. Well, I’d be remiss for not delving in to that a little bit here. Please see my Analysis section below for discussion on this. Harmonic Distortion:Measurements were completed in the nearfield (approximately 0.30 meters with room correction applied via Klippel’s ISC module) using Klippel’s TRF module. Multiple output levels were tested to provide the trend of distortion component profiles and to provide a comparison against other drive units I have tested. The SPL provided is relative to 1 meter distance, averaged in the noted bandpass region.Maximum Long Term SPL:The below data provides the metrics for how Maximum Long Term SPL is determined. This measurement follows the IEC 60268-21 Long Term SPL protocol, per Klippel’s template, as such:Rated maximum sound pressure according IEC 60268-21 §18.4Using broadband multi-tone stimulus according §8.4Stimulus time = 60 s Excitation time + Preloops according §18.4.1Each voltage test is 1 minute long (hence, the “Long Term” nomenclature).The thresholds to determine the maximum SPL are:-20dB Distortion relative to the fundamental-3dB compression relative to the reference (1V) measurementWhen the speaker has reached either or both of the above thresholds, the test is terminated and the SPL of the last test is the maximum SPL. In the below results I provide the summarized table as well as the data showing how/why this SPL was deemed to be the maximum.This measurement is conducted twice:First with a 20Hz to 20kHz multitone signalSecond with a limited 80Hz to 20kHz signalThe reason for the two measurements is because it is unfair to expect a small bookshelf speaker to extend low in frequency. Applying both will provide a good idea of the limitations if you were to want to run a speaker full range vs using one with a typical 80Hz HPF. And you will have a way to compare various speakers’ SPL limitations with each other. However, note: the 80Hz signal is a “brick wall” and does not emulate a typical 80Hz HPF slope of 24dB/octave. But… it’s close enough.You can watch a demonstration of this testing via my YouTube channel: Test 1: 20Hz to 20kHzMultitone compression testing. The red line shows the final measurement where either distortion and/or compression failed. The voltage just before this is used to help determine the maximum SPL.Multitone distortion testing. The dashed blue line represents the -20dB (10% distortion) threshold for failure. The dashed red line is for reference and shows the 1% distortion mark (but has no bearing on pass/fail). The green line shows the final measurement where either distortion and/or compression failed. The voltage just before this is used to help determine the maximum SPL.Test 2: 80Hz to 20kHzMultitone compression testing. The red line shows the final measurement where either distortion and/or compression failed. The voltage just before this is used to help determine the maximum SPL.Multitone distortion testing. The dashed blue line represents the -20dB (10% distortion) threshold for failure. The dashed red line is for reference and shows the 1% distortion mark (but has no bearing on pass/fail). The green line shows the final measurement where either distortion and/or compression failed. The voltage just before this is used to help determine the maximum SPL.The above data can be summed up by looking at the tables above but is provided here again:Max SPL for 20Hz to 20kHz is approximately 103dB @ 1 meter. The compression threshold was exceeded above this SPL.Max SPL for 80Hz to 20kHz is approximately 102dB @ 1 meter. The compression threshold was exceeded above this SPL.Surprisingly, the max SPL test from 20Hz to 20kHz is higher than that of the 80Hz to 20kHz test. However, only 1dB different. A re-test yielded the same results.Extra Measurements:Simulated Response Using Low-Shelf Filter at 200Hz.Given the LF trim of this speaker, I decided to see what a simple low-shelf filter would do in order to correct the response and flatten it. Think of this as a ‘tonal contour’. I applied a single low-frequency shelf at 200Hz with a gain of 3.5dB and a Q of 0.70 to arrive at the below CEA-2034 response curve set.As you can see, the response is incredibly smooth and flat wtih this single band of EQ applied. I discuss my subjective impressions of this adjustment in the subjective evaluation section below.Nearfield measurements.Mic placed about 0.50 inches - relative to the baffle - from each drive unit and port. While I tried to make these as accurate in SPL as I could, I cannot guarantee the relative levels are absolutely correct so I caution you to use this data as a guide but not representative of actual levels (measuring in the nearfield makes this hard as a couple millimeters’ difference between measurements can alter the SPL level).Notice how there is no resonance in the nearfield measurements. It’s not at all unusual to see port resonance or woofer resonance outside the crossover; these issues tend to creep up as distortion (linear and non-linear) in the speaker evaluation. However, there is none of that here.Step-Response.Subjective Evaluation:Before I dive in to the subjective feedback let me first give you the layout of my room…If the false wall part is odd to you, here's some background. I don't like seeing speakers when watching a movie. So, I built a false wall and used an acoustically transparent screen with speakers behind it. The wall is only 2x4's; no panels of wood or anything. Just a skeleton of a wall to give me something to attach the screen and acoustic treatment to. There is 2-inch wedge foam affixed to the 2x4 studs and between the false wall and back of the room are the front speakers (L/C/R & 18-inch subwoofers).My demo music:Title Artist Album Enjoy The SilenceDepeche ModeBest Of Depeche Mode, Vol. 1Higher LoveSteve WinwoodBack In The High Life (MFSL UDCD-611)24K MagicBruno Mars24K MagicMagicThe CarsHeartbeat City (MFSL)Everlasting LoveHoward JonesThe Best of Howard JonesKodachromePaul SimonThere Goes Rhymin’ SimonEverybody Wants To Rule The WorldTears for FearsSongs from the Big Chair (2014 Deluxe Edition - Disc 1)Know Your EnemyRage Against The MachineRage Against The Machine (Hybrid SACD)Doo Wop (That Thing)Lauryn HillThe Miseducation of Lauryn HillTell Yer MamaNorah JonesThe FallDon’t Save MeHAIMDays Are GoneHe Mele No LiloMark Keali’i Ho’omalu and Kamehameha Schools Children’s ChorusLilo And StitchWrapped Around Your FingerThe PoliceSynchronicitySledgehammerPeter GabrielSoFeel It StillPortugal. The ManWoodstockFree FallinJohn MayerWhere The Light IsWhiplashThe SwampersMuscle Shoals Has Got The SwampersNote: I don’t generally audition speakers with the typical “audiophile” music. I have thousands of high-quality albums ranging from pop to metal to jazz and all around. I don’t typically listen to “audiophile” music because I just don’t enjoy it. It is far more important that your evaluation music be something you are familiar with than it is to be esoteric for the sake of being esoteric. You also want to listen to music you enjoy because auditioning a stereo system shouldn’t feel like a chore. Such is the case in my evaluations. Besides, the subjective evaluation is purely to help tie to the objective data and make sense of what I am hearing to help you all get an understanding of how relevant the data is. As you will see below, my music selection did a great job at providing enough range for me to identify the issues that readily appear in the data.Subjective Analysis Setup:The speaker was aimed on-axis with the vertical listening axis on the tweeter axis.I used Room EQ Wizard (REW) and my calibrated MiniDSP UMIK-1 to get the volume on my AVR relative to what the actual measured SPL was in the MLP (~11 feet from the speakers). I varied it between 85-90dB, occasionally going up to the mid 90’s to see what the output capability was. In a poll I found most listen to music in this range.All speakers are provided a relatively high level of Pseudo Pink-Noise for a day or two - with breaks in between - in order to calm any “break-in” concerns.I demoed these speakers without a crossover. However, based on the simulations discussed previously, I demoed these both with and without EQ. The EQ applied was done so via my MiniDSP using a simple low-shelf filter with Q = 0.70, Gain = +3.5dB and Fo = 200Hz.Components: Oppo BDP-103 playing music off my thumb drive feeding signal via HDMI to a Denon AVR-X4000 which then feeds in to a refurbished Adcom GFA-545 for power.I initially listened to these speakers and made my subjective notes before I started measuring objectively. I did not want my knowledge of the measurements to influence my subjective opinion. This is important because I want to try to correlate the objective data with what I hear in my listening space in order to determine the validity of the measurement process. I try to do a few listening sessions over a couple days so I can give my ears a break and come back “fresh”.Upon measuring and finding the low frequency trim, I applied the EQ above and did another round of listening.Below is the measured in-room response at the main listening position (MLP) in blue, across the front row of seats (red) both compared against the predicted in-room response (black). You can see the prediction follows pretty reasonably to what is measured in the seated position, aside from the major modal dip at ~125Hz and the dip between 2-3kHz.The measurements/prediction below do not have EQ applied.Here’s the rundown of my subjective notes (in quotes) and where it fits with objective:Before I start, let me talk about Low Frequency Trim: As the speakers are (without low frequency adjustment) the sound is very, very neutral in the midbass region. What stood out to me the most in my initial listen is simply that the typical resonances of my room weren’t “activated” like they normally are. Which made for a pleasant listening session without a lot of overbearing ringing. I found 2000’s rock music to be more listenable as well. For example, I played Andrew W.K.‘s “Party Hard” on a whim. This song has multiple elements/tracks in the mix thrown together and typically sounds very congested/compressed because of the actual limited dynamic range itself… typically at higher volumes it just doesn’t sound as “fun” anymore. But with the Purezza “stock” it was enjoyable at higher output levels. I attribute this to both the low distortion but also the low frequency trim. When adding the low shelf EQ of +2.5dB @ 200Hz, bass quality improved to a more ‘expected’ fuller sound but brought out resonances in the room more easily.With the above said, the below notes are a mixture of me using the speaker in “stock” form as well as with adding a low shelf.Soundstage Depth: Depth to stage (from my seated position to the front of the soundstage) is 5 feet in front of me. The stage depth itself (front to back of soundstage) is deeeeeep.Soundstage Width: Crazy wide.The Purezzas possess the best soundstage I have heard to date. A very wide, very deep but also very symmetrical soundstage without one side lagging or the other side coming more forward or being more extended. Most people don’t seem to catch on to assymetry in soundstage but once you do, it’s hard to ignore and makes the stereo rendering seem fake (as if the illusion of stereo isn’t already, but I digress). These speakers do not have the problem.Higher Love - guitar playing in first verse sounds like it’s 5 feet to the left-front of me. Very deep soundstage. Timbre of midrange is so freaking pure. Shakers/tambourines??? add layer of sound. Width is to wall 3 feet to the left.24k Magic - Excellent sound of ‘air’ even at moderate volumes (don’t have to turn it up to hear the details). 98dB. Even at 101dB the distortion is incredibly low but I can hear the woofers give (PR on back?). Crazy how loud these get with no hint of distortion.The Cars - Magic - Shaker at R-C just comes out of stage. High Hat on L-C clear as a bell even though it’s somewhat low in the mix. Bass guitar; can hear the mechanical vibration of the string itself (in addition to the obvious amplified string).I wanted more ~ 120-160Hz but room mode there.Tears For Fears - opening synth; can hear higher frequency portion I hadn’t heard before. Resonance in mix doesn’t show up as boomy in reproduction; actually helps give the acoustic space more room. Hadn’t noticed that before. Heard backup singers @ 2:00 I never noticed before.RATM - Know Your Enemy: Enveloping sound due to wide stage left and rightTell Yer Mama - Great sense of space in the recording; not overly bright like sometimes ~ 0:39 + (background sound fading in and out)Wrapped Around Your Finger - Bass line is incredible. Can hear the vibrato of it and it actually has a tangible feel as it energizes the roomBottom LineThe Selah Audio Purezza is a very accurate and enjoyable speaker. While the low frequency trend native to the speaker may be a problem to some, it can be resolved by Rick easily from what he says. I simply used an electronic low-shelf filter to resolve this and was on my way (and, thus, my comments below are with this adjustment).The soundstage is incredible. Focus is top notch. There were no gripes of mine once I made the LF trim correction (before this, the top end sounded a bit hot).The distortion is at dangerously low levels. What does that even mean?… Well, most of the time distortion is an indicator that the volume is too loud. We hear distortion and we turn it down. With these speakers, I was often in the 95-100dB level (at 11 feet, no less) without having a clue it was that loud.I have yet to hear a speaker of this size with this level of neutrality. The midrange is so distortion-free that it’s like listening to your music collection with a new set of ears/memory. I have to think that this is pushing the envelope, if not exceeding it, for performance in this size class and cost.I wholeheartedly recommend the Selah Audio Purezza speakers if they are within your budget.ContributeIf you like what you see here and want to help me keep it going, please consider donating via PayPal here.

It is the mains (left and right) of a 5.1 package which was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $1099 (for all six speaker).The Cinema 100 is elegantly finished in its little package:There is a removable stand that also routes the speaker wires to the small terminals in the back.  It is an attempt to hide the wiring on the back in case the speakers are exposed.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 800 measurement which resulted in error rate of roughly 1% to 2%.Testing temperature was around 64 degrees F.Reference axis for measurements was the center of the tweeter (by eye). Grill was not used in either measurements or listening tests.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Paradigm Cinema 100 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: The frequency response error is quite obvious to see.  It first droops but then rises starting at 1 kHz until it finished in a large tweeter resonance around 15 kHz:Early window mimics the same for good and bad:Final predicted in-room response tells us what we can already guess with too little bass (this is a sealed box) and too much highs:Distortion is under control although that is mostly because the woofer is not allowed to play low:Directivity scales with frequency which means there is not much control:Vertical directivity is better going up than down so don't put the tweeter below your ear axis:Finally, here is the impedance and phase:Listening TestsI listened to the Cinema 100 without its sub (which I did not have).  As expected, it sounded tinny and bright.  Attempts at EQ were not successful.  Likely needs to be tuned with its sub playing at the same time.ConclusionsI like to evaluate speakers as stand-alone units without a sub.  Here, it is impossible to do since a sub is supplied normally with the unit.  Even so, it is clear the company wanted to let the highs play brighter as to sell better in a showroom.  How critical do we get in this class of speakers though?  I don't know.  I let you decide.  I have no recommendation one way or the other.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150"

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: This is not bad!  On-axis response is very good if one ignores a few bumps.  Directivity is very good although flatter than one would want in a hi-fi speaker (could sound a bit bright).  We can see the cause of the three bumps easily in near-field measurements:The most obvious is the port resonance which interferes with woofer response.  The high frequency one is caused by the unevenness of the tweeter.Early window reflections are similar to on-axis due to good directivity:Predicted in-room response is as we would expect:Impedance dips to 4.5 ohm which is typical of these bookshelf speakers:I was impressed with the low distortion of B1+:Horizontal beamwidth is smooth and even as predicted from spin data:You have a bit of freedom relative to how you align you ear to reference axis (center of the tweeter):Emotiva Airmotiv B1+ Listening TestsGeneral performance and tonality here was good.  As was the ability to play loud and I mean really loud.  There is hardly any deep bass which helps with the small driver not bottoming out or getting overly distorted.  Occasionally I would think the sound was a hair bright.  And in general, a bit muddy.  So I pulled out the EQ tool to knock down the resonant peaks:Ah, now I had the clarity that I wanted to hear!  Then again, could be imagination given the small corrections.    If you have this speaker, try these and report back.ConclusionsLooks like the money was put toward good engineering with Emotiva Airmotiv B1+.  A port resonance is the main thing that is missed but otherwise, this is a good design that should sound good in many spaces due to nice directivity.Overall I am happy to put Emotiva Airmotiv B1+ on my recommended list.  With equalization, its score could even bump higher that what is awarded here.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

This is what he has post on the cost: ""A kit for pair of ZA5.2 MTs is about $292 (with binding posts) and pair of cabinets would be about $50 (from PE). So, assuming free shipping to me, the total cost is about $342.""The build for the unit I received was quite substantial:Clever use of textured paint to give something extra to an otherwise bland sides.  That said, it cannot compete in looks with either vinyl wraps or painted enclosure from commercial suppliers.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 2.7 Hz.  Previous tests used 0.7 Hz resolution which hugely inflated the storage requirements and was well beyond what research calls for.  I scanned at 0.7 Hz as well and difference was negligible so I will be going with this resolution from here on.All measurements are relative to tweeter center.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:I must say, I was impressed with how flat the response is on-axis (red arrow).  The dips in mid frequency though don't track the same way in early window (dashed blue) so causes the directivity index (dashed blue at the bottom) to vary.   This is usually due to mismatch of the directivity of the woofer and tweeter.Note the very low sensitivity.  You better have lots of wattage to drive these little speakers.Predicted in-room response is somewhat ragged and depending on how you draw the line through it, may have too little slope (i.e. sound bright):Impedance is higher than many mass market speakers:Distortion seems to show the struggle of the little midwoofer driver trying to produce bass:Here is the waterfall:And contours:Speaker Listening TestsIn use the ZA5 in my main system sounded quite bright.  This was not due to tilted up highs but lack of any bass to speak of.  There isn't lower bass.  There isn't midbass.  As predicted from measurements, efficiency is quite poor causing me to turn up my amplifier to very high amplification levels (1000 watts on tap) to drive them.  Before you got any bass the highs were killing you and the midwoofer would start to bottom out.  On the latter though, it took a ton of power before it mildly stepped into that region.With one speaker and in a very large space, these speakers don't do it for me subjectively.ConclusionsOn-axis performance is surprisingly good as is craftsmanship of @Winkleswizard.  Ultimately though, there is just no bass response and with it, music is not music.  For a few hundred dollars you want to have bass.  I know you can add a sub but that limits the audience a ton.So personally I don't think we have shown the DIY route has merit with this sample, sad to say.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.With the stock market crashing, I am not feeling like I have any assets left.

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,598 a pair.BRX looks pretty fancy but doesn't weigh a lot:It is an unusual design in passive compact speakers by having dual passive radiators, one on each side:I worry about how compromised the cabinet is with all those large holes.  BTW, the back is smooth.  The textured look is from my lighting.There is a grill which you may want to use as otherwise the bottom ""chin"" looks pretty ugly to me.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was the center of AMT driver (aligned by eye). It is getting colder with the measurement room temp at 15 degrees C.GoldenEar BRX MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:This is a kind of graph that makes you go ""hmmm.""  For starters, the bass and upper midrange is quite uneven.  I imagine this is due to the turning of the dual passive radiator on the bottom side.  We then have a region of disturbance from 600 to 1000 Hz.  The things get smoother but there is some resonance around 4000 Hz.  Near-field response gives us some clues as to what may be going:Seems like the midrange issue has dual causes: the woofer has bump there so seems like baffle compensation is not sufficient.  At the same time the passive radiator is peaking.  This will cause a directivity error due to its higher frequency and side firing radiator.  There is a more pronounced resonance around 4 kHz which at first seems too low level.  But it is competing with severe off-axis response of the tweeter so likely sends out some unwanted noise to the sides.  Keep in mind though that these (near-field) measurements are approximate.Back to our spin graph, the early window reflection is quite messy because the on-axis wasn't that clean to begin with:Here is the simulated response in a room:I hate it when the bass response of a speaker is this uneven because the room adds to it so there is no direct path to equalization.Directivity is variable due to beaming of the tweeter (being too large for the wavelengths it is producing):This makes the sound room sensitive and potentially difficult to EQ or even assess.Vertical is what we expect from a 2-way design with even more beaming due to larger size of the AMT tweeter vertically:Distortion at low volume is good but gets out of line across the full audio band:It is one thing for a small speaker like this to get distorted in bass.  But one hopes that it doesn't spread to the rest of the spectrum as audibility thresholds become far more acute.Impedance dips very low to 3.3 ohm:For fans of timing analysis, here is the CSD/Waterfall and Impulse response:GoldenEar BRX Listening Tests and EqualizationI got off to a rocky start with this speaker.  It left me with a very variable impression.  One moment it would sound good, next moment not.  So I pulled out the EQ to correct the response errors.  I used both the on-axis response strategy and PIR.  Neither were effective across more than one track in controlled blind testing.  I would think I had an improvement, go to the next track and perform blind AB test and would like no EQ better.  Very frustrating.I took a different strategy of playing a bass heavy track and then listening to the radiator and woofer by themselves (I blocked the tweeter with my hand).  The radiator was definitely falling apart with sub-bass at any above medium playback level.  Trying to fix that, I dialed in simple but sharp high-pass filter:You would think you lose bass this way and you do a tiny but the overall impression was one of reduction in brightness!!!  How is that possible?  Again, I cupped my hand over the tweeter and listened to the woofer alone.  With the filter in place you just hear warm bass.  Turn the EQ off and it develops a sharper overhand which is likely due to severe harmonic distortion (higher order ones).  With the filter in place, I lost any ability to play sub-bass but overall outcome was universally good.But how good?  I swapped out the BRC for Revel M105  which costs a bit less.  This is its spinorama:Ah, what a transformation.  Tonality, detail and larger spatial image was all fantastic.  It even had more tactile bass than BRX (no EQ was used in the comparison).Conclusions$1,600 is a lot of money to charge for small bookshelf speakers.  You best deliver great performance.  Alas, I am not seeing that in the BRX.  Not that it is terrible but that clearly enough engineering was not put in there to create great tonality.  It presents a very complex soundfield that likely is difficult to EQ (manual or automatic) to boot.  Is it terrible?  No, not by any stretch.  The deviations are small but collectively left me aggravated.I can't recommend the GoldenEar BRX.  It doesn't deliver a better experience than budget speakers well below its price.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I purchased it at suggestion of members and donations toward it.  It costs US $329 a pair from the company as of this writing.  It is apparently the fifth revision of this design and hence the numerical designation.Despite being small, the cabinet feels quite heavy and solid:I like the binding posts but they are too close to each other making it hard to run them:This speaker seems to have a massive following ignited by a review of earlier version of it by CNET praising it.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Using computational acoustics, far-field response is computed and that is what I present. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber.I performed over 1000 measurement which resulted in error rate of about 1%. Clean high frequency response is responsible for ease of measurement in this regard.Reference axis is approximately the center of the tweeter (vertically and horizontally).  As a funny aside, when I was searching for measurements of this speaker, I landed on a massive thread in AVS Forum with a person claiming I will be botching this as I am supposed to contact the company to get the acoustic center.  Well, if it is very different than assumed, company best to provide that information to all of its users. More on this later.Chane A1.5 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Ouch.  This is not what I expected to see for a speaker with so much praise.  Efficiency was low as also evidenced by me having to crank up the levels to get it to measurement point.  Response peaks in treble region and there is some nasty business both in on-axis and off-axis response around a few hundred hertz to nearly 2 kHz.  By measuring the drivers and port we get some clues as to potential reasons:We see the classic budget speaker cabinet/port resonance peaking as the woofer response is going down causing it to be much more of a problem than it would be otherwise.  Tweeter response is also quite uneven.Early window response due to poor directivity is a mess:Normally I could tell you to both absorbers here and there to help the situation but I can't think of anything.  Each reflection contributes randomly to the response -- by eye anyway.No wonder then that our predicted in-room response is quite choppy:It also appears to not slope down much so likely sound bright.Company talks a lot about the distortion levels in the woofer and seems like there is something to that:As seen though, they need to do something about the tweeter.Even during the sweep with hearing protection I could tell at 96 dB SPL there were problems.As we would expect, horizontal beamwidth cannot be described at any fixed angle:It is so uneven and broad at some frequencies that I think the sound will be very room dependent.  Same is seen in our contour map:Vertically the tweeter heavily beams at the top of its range with strong narrowing of the response:Symmetry of the measurements is very good which means we did nail the acoustic center!  Here is our 3-D balloon plot at three mid frequencies;Sound source starts as a uniform surface but then splits into two before unifying back again.Impedance for the most part is high so your amplifier should be happier:Then again the low sensitivity as noted earlier will require a powerful amplifier to play loud.You all have asked for impulse response, so here it is:Chane A1.5 Listening Tests and EQI must say, despite glancing at the measurements before listening to the A1.5, I was not ready for the experience that greeted me.  The sound was hyper bright and was energizing the room in a way that I have rarely heard.  Higher notes would linger in my large space.  The combination at first was impressively addictive until you some notes literally poke a hole in your eardrum and you realize you are listening to the classic ""showroom sound.""  Mind you, it is one of the best implementations of that besting what even Klipsch does but wrong it is.  So out came the EQ tool with shelving to bring the highs down:That wasn't enough so I went after the irregularities in 500 to 1500 hertz with dual filters to build a flat top (I did it visually and hence the fractions).  Once there, I tamed 90% of the brightness but some notes would still stand out.  I tried adding a bit of bass boost where there is a dip in upper bass/lower mid-range but that caused the speaker to run out of headroom and distort.  And kind of made it boomy so I omitted it.Power handling was very good.  The little woofer doesn't upset easy.  But something else was nice: there was this great spatial qualities to the speaker which I think is due to very wide directivity in lower treble area.  This may also be why it sounds bright because I don't have any side wall absorption.With all the filters in place, I listened for a good bit and soon I lost track that I was testing the speaker and instead enjoying its sound.ConclusionsObjectively the Chane A1.5 violates many rules for good sound in speaker design.  Sadly the same was present in listening tests.  Unless the showroom effect is in play, I can't figure out why the speaker is so popular.  Maybe people are using it in home theater applications where equalization is very common.  If so, sure, I could get pushed to get on board if you EQ them well.As is, I can't recommend the Chane A1.5.  You must use EQ and if you do, then you can get good sound out of it and maybe some unique characteristics. -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was sent to me by the company and costs US $2,499 for a pair.This is one substantial ""bookshelf"" speaker!  It weighs around 58 pounds.  The cabinet simultaneously feels nice and rigid.  The back panel binding posts are a work of art and would be at home in a $20,000 speaker:Speaker is designed in Norway but manufactured in China.I used the center of speaker as reference design and tested it with my Klippel Near-field Scanner without the grill.  You get two foams to block the rear ports.   I briefly tested the unit with them blocked but the rest of the measurements are with the port open.Arendal 1723 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual speaker frequency response measurements:As noted, response is almost flat on axis with a slight shelving up above 2 kHz.  Being an MTM design (dual woofers), we naturally get cancellations in that axis:So while the speaker is advertized to be usable in horizontal axis for home theater use, It is not the optimal choice there.  Due to mixing of the vertical response, full earl window reflections show unevenness:Predicted in-room response is much smoother though:We basically have a lifted > 2 kHz response which I noted earlier.  And perhaps a dip around 1.4 kHz.Near-field measurement shows a pronounced port/cabinet resonance but this did not show up in our anechoic measurements:A major benefit of dual woofers is low distortion and we clearly see that:Per above, I tried to test the in-room response with or without the port stuffed but clearly I didn't do a good job as the response difference should be larger than this.Our beamwidth and directivity tell us what we already know:Here is the impedance and phase:Finally, we have the step response (sorry, forgot to run waterfall):Arendal 1723 Speaker Listening Test and Equalization:Due to weight, I tested the 1723 in our living room as the review picture shows although the location was to the left with no adjacent walls.  Out of box performance was excellent.  There was no hint of distortion except when I ran my tests with sub-bass.  There, there was a tiny hint of distortion which was far, far better than just about any bookshelf speaker (most can't even play that range).  I was really surprised how clean bass response was in general. I am wondering if the dual ports help a bit with room loading.  High frequency detail was very nice as well so I thought I check to make sure that is not due to excess energy with a shelving filter:While I liked it with the filter, I must say the higher level of detail without it was rather captivating.    Our youngest son was here so I had him listen.  He definitely thought without the filter it was too bright for him and had strong preference for the EQ.FYI, i tried to fill the directivity dip but it just made the sound brighter so I abandoned it. ConclusionsThe Arendal 1723 makes a strong showing in build and finish quality and power handling. Its frequency response is almost perfect with a slight hint of treble brightness which you may prefer.  The MTM configuration works well in vertical axis.  Not so sure about horizontal.  While I usually don't take price into the consider, I must in this instance: what makes the 1723 great is the low cost for this level of performance.  I think you will have a hard time finding an alternative that competes with it in price performance in bookshelf configuration.I am happy to put the Arendal 1723 speaker on my recommended list.  I am also happy that the company was willing to have its speaker tested by sending it to me.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I have what could arguably be called the best vintage speaker in the world that is ever produced.  That you haven't heard of its designation, MC-1000, is not my issue.  Please allow me to introduce you to the Realistic MC-1000:Don't let the low price of US $59.95 fool you.  This speaker used state-of-the-art components, far better than anything available today.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:What?  Maybe I didn't have the polarity of the wires straight.  Surely it is a far better speaker than this.  Maybe I can change the vertical scale enough to make the on-axis response flat as great speakers should have.What's that?  The directivity index has a lot of ups and downs?  Let me see:OK, I confess.  The early reflection directivity index should be straight like the arrow that I have drawn.  Maybe if you close your eyes, and listen to music with lights off, you won't hear those reflections around your room having little relationship with the direct sound.  You know, they make a soup that just might be tasty on the 100th play of Eagle's LP you keep spinning.If you want a picture of said soup, here it is:You don't need to buy a parametric EQ anymore.  You have one built-into this speaker which works wonders for all your music.  A nice peak above 10 kHz would do wonders in keeping you awake. Speaker Impedance MeasurementsHere is how the impedance (and phase) of the speaker vary based on frequency:Any little ""kinks"" in the phase/impedance curves indicates a resonance.  And we have plenty of this.  Translation: this is a very musical speaker, playing along its own tunes with your band.  A solo becomes a duo.  A duo becomes a trio and so on.  You put in one, and you get two.  Or three.And oh, you can see the same in frequency response measurement:Distortion MeasurementsIgnore the low frequencies as these measurements are supposed to be performed in anechoic chamber:Fascinating to see the high distortions above 1 kHz.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:This is an unusual design.  On-axis (black solid) is fairly even until about 3 kHz (where the tweeter takes over) but then we have a cycle of ups and downs.  Speculating, they are diffraction interfering with the on-axis sound.  Early window reflections that are at other angles, hardly show this problem (dashed blue top).   There are directivity errors because of this so correction may not be easy with equalization.We can look at the early window reflections in detail to confirm what I wrote above:So no wonder that when we put everything together to predict the in-room response, all seems well:Should sound good till we look at the distortion graphs with room effect filtered out:Wow, this is quite a bit of distortion and occurring at crossover points.  Is this a design problem with the coaxial driver?We see the issue quite clearly in the context of overall frequency response:I like to see nothing but blank space past 200 Hz and so yet we have many peaks here.  Distortion is so high that I almost think it may be a measurement error but then I look at the review of Elac Adante AS-61 speaker and we have a similar issue:That review did not use calibrated SPL levels but still, we clearly see the same rise in distortion at around 270 Hz.  And another one before 2 kHz, both of which are near crossover frequencies.This speaker makes a very good test case of whether distortion is an issue or not in absence of frequency response errors!Our impedance and phase graph also shows a resonance point:We kinda see the first resonance point in the CSD/waterfall as well:You can see a trend around 300 Hz which dies down near 6 millisecond mark.Coaxial driver brings with it good vertical directivity and we see some sign of it here:Speaker Listening TestsMy first impression of tonality was good.  Plenty of warmth due to bass response.  Nice ability to play as loud as you want.  But yet... the sound is not impressing me.  Vocals, both female and male, sounded wrong for example.I dial in some EQ for the elevated response above 1 kHz and that helps but still not there.  I am out of normal tricks with EQ at this point as I usually have a clear guidebook of resonance peaks.So I applying EQ to the clear distortion peaks.  Reduction of level should reduce their levels as we see in the comparison graph of 86 and 96 dB above.  I put those in together with my dip for my room mode:This made a pretty good difference.  Sound was more open, with more detail.  I kept the Q high so that the impact on the frequency response is low (narrow notches).At this point speakers became ""good.""  They provide a diffused image which I like (especially since I am listening to a single channel in my reviews).ConclusionsFor a second time we see that the magic of coaxial drivers tends to be more for the eye than the ear.  Distortion continues to be quite high and we have wavy output at highest frequencies.  Perhaps there is no such thing as a cheap and good coaxial driver.Or, I could be all wrong and they are fine.    I tend to be much more sensitive to distortion as party of my training so what bothered me, may not bother others.Overall, I can't recommend the Elac BS U5.  If you apply some equalization as I have, I could be pushed to recommend them for their high power handling and good tonality.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.This is the second review of the day.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: The good news is sensitivity at or above 90 dB depending on how you average the curve.  This means you will be able to get to higher loudness or with less amplification power for the same loudness.  The bad news is that we have a chewed up response with pronounced dip around 800 Hz and directivity error around mid to tweeter driver (2 kHz).  And of course a peaking response above 3 kHz but perhaps this could be adjusted with the dial on the speaker.The above causes the estimated room response to have rather high treble energy:Here is our early reflections that sum with the rest of the measurements to produce the above graph:Since we have dual terminals in the back, I broke the connection between them and measured the tweeter+mid and woofer separately and got this composite graph (room compensated):We see peaks and dips in the woofer before dying down.  It appears to be comb filtering, i.e. another delayed source mixing with it.  The tweeter has the same dip though at the offending 850 Hz or so which I can't explain.While we are on this graph, let's look at the distortion data, this time filtered for room response (which would have made low frequency worse due to room modes):We are used to seeing low frequency peaks that go off the chart but not here.  That large paper woofer is doing a good job of playing loud but without a lot of distortion.  Here it is in absolute level:Impedance dips are controlled so this should not be a hard speaker to drive:There are fair number of kinks in there which you can see better when I zoom in:Here is our waterfall which again has room compensation:We see the issue near 1 kHz.  Frequency response is a bit poor so it doesn't show a narrow peak where our problem is.Here is our horizontal directivity plot:The directivity width varies with frequency and we have sudden dips and peaks.Vertical directivity in non-coaxial designs is usually not good but this is worse than normal:Speaker Listening TestsI did not have a low stand to put the 4319 on so used the same I have been using with bookshelf speakers.  This placed the tweeter a few inches above my ear level.  The positive is that that woofer can generate a lot of bass.  The cabinet resonates a lot but when I put my ear to it while playing female vocals, I could not hear much at all.  So most of the cabinet resonances are at lower frequencies which we can see from waterfall plot.The bad news is that not much that I played on the 4319 sounded that good.  It was kind of boxy and closed in with some brightness at times.  I thought being old school speaker, it perhaps is a better fit for older music.  So I queued up The Girl from Ipanema on my Reel to Reel tape deck and boy, did it sound disappointing.  ConclusionsBoth objectively and subjectively I was disappointed in the results of JBL 4319.  We have advanced in understanding what makes good sound at home since this speaker was designed.  I can see its appeal in its look and pedigree but it sure is not for me.   The woofer though is low distortion and produces copious amount of bass which combined with higher efficiency, would pair well with low power amplifier.  Perhaps such use with a tube amp to change its response and/or playing with controls would make it sound better.  For this reason, I did not give it the lowest score possible, but one step above.Overall I can't recommend the JBL 4319 unless you like looking at it more than listening to it.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Out of imagination for another lame joke so simple request: please donate what you can using : https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I completed the Bose 901 Series V speaker review and have posted it to my website.  I am copying/pasting the majority of it here but go to the site if you want to read everything (or if links don't work here, etc).https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/loudspeakers/bose_901_series_v/ I'm proud of this one.  Lots of work and time went in to creating this. About 20 hours so far.  But I learned a lot and hopefully others will, too.This speaker is definitely getting a YouTube review.  There's no way to go through everything I want to say without spending several more hours.Bose 901 Series V Speaker ReviewWednesday, Jul 22, 2020IntroA few things that need to be stated up front before people skip this and go to the pictures:Pay attention to the Title of each graph. This speaker comes with an EQ that has all sorts of various slider positions. I tested the speaker “Raw” (without the EQ in-line) first. Then I tested it with the EQ in-line, with a few different setting configurations. There is a lot to unpack here. The title of each graph tells you how the settings were made. Please pay attention to the titles; otherwise you will get confused as to what is going on.Some may be concerned that this “Spinorama” data doesn’t take in to affect the speakers needing to be close to a surface. I have attached an image below but to summarize: The speakers should be placed at least 18 inches from side walls (with a recommendation of 2-4 feet from side walls) and 8-16 inches from the rear wall. The “Spinorama” data does not take this into account. And, at this point, I do not know how to manipulate the data in a way to “trick” the Spinorama graphics in to showing what would happen when you place them in the manner they were designed to be placed. Although, one can make the case that the SPL is simply adjusted by +6dB for this proximity and transition from the standard 4-pi reference to a 2-pi reference (free space vs near-wall). That’s just the reality. So, before anyone gets up in arms about this factor; yes, I am fully aware of the potential limitation related to this speaker’s direct/reflective design.The EQ was always in-line in my listening sessions.Moving on…The Bose 901 has been around for 50+ years and has long been considered a divisive product within the audiophile community. I was born in 1982 and until this week I had never heard the Bose 901 speakers. I’d just heard about them. Everything we all have heard and read. The same old clichés. Some love them. Some love the nostalgia of them. Some despise them and everything they represent; from the company to the product performance and how it colors (no pun intended) listeners’ perception of what good sound is supposed to be.There have been some who have provided measurements of these speakers (NoAudiophile did here). However, there are no measurements that replicate anechoic data. Additionally, with the gaining popularity of the CEA/CTA-2034 method of providing a complete set of measurements and a prediction for in-room performance based on Floyd Toole’s work, I couldn’t stop wondering not only how the 901 would sound to me but also how they would fare in the CTA-2034 standard set of curves. Long story short, a fellow forum member of AudioScienceReview was kind enough to send me his pair of Bose 901 Series V speakers. Funny side story: he was going to send the Series IV he owned but had issues when it came time to refoam them so he sourced a very good condition pair of Series V’s and shipped them to me. Given the Series VI is the last production model and that the Series V and IV (apparently) only differ in cosmetic fashion, I was happy to have the “latest” 901 version to test.This version consists of a single “full range” 4.5 inch driver up front and 8… yes, 8… 4.5 full range drivers in the back. The idea is to place these near a rear-wall and the 8 speakers in the back would create an enveloping sound. Well, they certainly do that. But, as you can imagine, they are not what I would consider accurate or reference speakers. Still, they’re novel and I rather enjoy the novelty. I get why people hate them. I also understand why people love them. If I had endless money and space, I’d love to have these in a dedicated room as an alternative to a reference system. Something to go in to, plop down in a big comfy chair and just kick back and enjoy these for what they are: a novelty speaker that does bring a grin to my face.I’ll get back to my subjective thoughts later but for now let’s move on to the data.Foreword: Subjective Analysis vs Objective Data (click for more)Product Specs and PhotosObjective DataBefore I dive into the test, let me reiterate the fact this speaker has a multitude of EQ options. I tested the speaker “raw”, primarily. I also tested with the EQ in-line varying the settings. So, again, please read the title of each graphic because these tell you what was measured in that particular instance.When the graph says “No EQ” that means there was No EQ In-Line for the measurement. In other words, this is a raw speaker measurement.Unless otherwise noted, all the data below was captured using Klippel Distortion Analyzer 2 and Klippel modules (TRF, DIS, LPM, ISC to name a few). Most of the data was exported to a text file and then graphed using my own MATLAB scripts in order to present the data in a specific way I prefer. However, some is given using Klippel’s graphing.EQ Box TestingI used Klippel’s Distortion Analyzer 2 to capture the Bose 901 Series V’s various EQ settings. As you can see from the above photo of the EQ box there are various slider positions for “Mid Bass” and “Mid Treble”. There is also a “Bass” setting which accentuates the lower bass. I have provided two graphics below showing 1) difference between “Bass 1” and “Bass 2” (when EQ is set to the Neutral position) and 2) the comparison of the MidBass and MidTreble sliders (with Bass = 2).As you can see below, the “Bass” button boosts the LF response another 5dB or so.These are a sampling of the various EQ slider positions, where Bass = 2. The yellow line is the “EQ Neutral” setting; meaning the EQ sliders were at the middle detent … I also refer to this as “flat”, even though it’s not electrically flat… it’s just the default setting. As you can see, there is a lot of swing available on both ends and the 1kHz region is the closest to the same any of these settings comes to.Impedance Phase and MagnitudeImpedance measurements are provided both at 0.10 volts RMS and 2.83 volts RMS. The low-level voltage version is standard because it ensures the speaker/driver is in linear operating range. The higher voltage is to see what happens when the output voltage is increased to the 2.83vRMS speaker sensitivity test. I did measure with the EQ in-line but there was no meaningful difference so I won’t bother sharing the results.From the above data we can see the following:The tuning frequency is in the low 30’s.Lots of little resonances; namely the minor dip at 650Hz followed by the peak/dip at ~1kHz. Then another around 2.5kHz.Yes, the scale of the Phase is crazy; that’s a real measurement and I don’t know what’s going on to cause such a wild shift here. So I am leaving it.Frequency ResponseNotes about measurements (click for info)The measurement below provides the frequency response at the reference measurement axis - also known as the 0-degree axis or “on axis” plane - in this measurement condition was situated at the ribbon.The mean SPL without EQ in-line is approximately 81dB at 2.83v/1m, calculated over the frequency range of 300Hz to 3,000Hz.The blue shaded area represents the ±3dB response window from my calculated mean SPL value. As you can see in the blue window above, the Bose 901 Series V sans EQ has a ±3dB response from 62Hz - 20kHz. The ±1.5dB window is even worse. But, it’s a single 4.5” woofer with an off-shaped (by modern standards) baffle. Not making excuses. Just saying.Now let’s look at a couple other measurements with the EQ in-line. Again, the title tells the EQ setup.Below are both the horizontal and vertical response over a limited window (90° horizontal, ±40° vertical). I have provided a “normalized” set of data as well. The normalization simply means that I took the difference of the on-axis response and compared the other axes’ measurements to the on-axis response which gives the viewer a good idea of the speaker performance, relative to the on-axis response, as you move off-axis.As I said above, the provided frequency response graphs were given with a limited set of data. I measured the response of the speaker’s vertical and horizontal axis in 10-degree steps over 360-degrees. Nearly 70 measurements in total are represented in my data. As you can imagine, providing all those data points in a single FR-type graphic below is a bit overwhelming and confusing for the viewer. A spectrogram is an alternate way to view this full set of data. This takes a 360-degree set of data and “collapses” it down to a rectangular representation of the various angles’ SPL. I have provided two sets of data: one set for horizontal and one for vertical. Each set consists of 2 graphics:Full response (20Hz - 20kHz with the angles from 0° to ±180°) with absolute SPL valuesFull, “normalized” response (20Hz - 20kHz with the angles from 0° to ±180°) with SPL values relative to the 0-degree axisNormalized plots make it easier to compare how the speaker’s off-axis response behaves relative to the on-axis response curve.The above spectrograms are the standard way of providing directivity graphics by most reviewers. Some prefer not to normalize the data. Some prefer to normalize the data. Either way, it’s a useful visual to get an idea of the directivity characteristics of a speaker or driver.However, these “collapsed” representations of the sound field are not very intuitively viewed. At least not to me. So, I came up with a different way to view the speaker’s horizontal and vertical sound field by providing it across a 360° range in a globe plot below. I have provided both an absolute SPL version as well as a normalized version of both the horizontal and vertical sound fields.Note the legend provided in the top left of each image which helps you understand speaker orientation provided in my global plots below.Now let’s look at a couple other measurements with the EQ in-line. Again, the title tells the EQ setup.This is with the EQ in-line but set to neutral (middle detent).This is with the EQ in-line with the MidBass set to Neutral and the MidTreble set to max.Bottom line here is the majority of this speaker’s sound is radiated toward the back. Not a real surprise. But very interesting to see how a speaker like this looks in this graphical format."

It was kindly sent to me by a member.  It costs about US $250 for a single which is quite high for such a small speaker (owner says he paid a lot less though).  But this is from a name brand company so maybe it is worth the premium.There is nothing square about this speaker:A L-shaped cheap plastic grill covered the front drivers and passive radiator on top:No, that is not a hair from our white dogs on the right.  It is a strand of glue or something.  Left it in there just in case it was put in there intentionally!!!Back panel shows the high recessed binding posts which were difficult to use:It made it difficult to terminate with bare wires I use to reduce interference with the measurement system.There is a triangular footer underneath so I removed it for testing.  Glad I ran a sweep through it as the speaker literally started to jump up and down and walk away!  So had to put it back on to stabilize it.   This also prompted me to not test it above 86 dB SPL as you see later in the review.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which still was not quite enough to estimate the soundfield given the resonance/interference at the highest frequencies.  Still, error is near 1% so certainly good enough for what we want.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:This is one of the more unique responses we have seen so far.  Bass response slopes down for a while before dropping rapidly.  This reduces the available bass energy between 40 and 120 Hz.  In addition, bass is clearly at lower amplitude than the rest of the spectrum.  We also have some severe resonance/interference going on at 14 kHz (end of the graph).  Importantly, the directivity plot (dashed blue, bottom) shows a sudden kink indicating that the tweeter's radiation pattern is not well matched to that the woofer.  This makes the off-axis response different than direct which is not a good thing.We see that more in this set of graphs of early reflections:Putting on-axis and reflections together gives us a predicted in-room response for an average domestic space:This indicates too much highs and too little lows potentially.The slow roll off for the bass seems to be helping with the distortion there:But then again we have peaks in higher frequencies we don't like to see:My limit for anything above 500 Hz is 0.5% and we are well above that here.Note that these are at 86 dB SPL because I was afraid of running them at typical 96 dB SPL so keep that in mind when comparing to other speakers.Directivity plots show what we already know:There is a null when you get above tweeter axis around 5 kHz so you should sit at or lower than tweeter axis.Finally, here is our CSD/waterfall graph:PS.  Forgot the impedance graph:Speaker Listening TestsThis speaker just sounds annoying.  Lack of deep bass makes it sound tubby (shallow bass response).  At the same time, the highs are exaggerated and not clean to boot.  I took one quick shot at equalizing but gave up.On the plus side, lack of deep bass allows you to turn it up higher assuming your ears can take the highs.  Mine could not.To make sure I was not in a lousy ""bad sound mood,"" I replaced the ProMonitor 1000 with the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR speaker.   Wow, what revelation!  The Pioneer sounded like a reference grade speaker compared to the Definitive Tech.  It sounded warm, balanced, and clean.  And they retail for US $118 for a pair or four times less than the Definitive Tech 1000.ConclusionsThis is an expensive speaker at $500 pair that sadly doesn't objectively or subjectively produce good results.  I am not sure what they were aiming for.   It is also too expensive in this day age.   It is just a bad experiment that should be forgotten.  Let's hope their larger tower speakers are better than this.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Definitive Technology ProMonitor 1000.  There is nothing ""Pro"" about it.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Get this: one of the panthers heard on TV that local hair salons have opened up and is insisting on getting his hair dyed green!

Grill was not used.JBL 4309 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:The eye immediately goes to that bunched up response around 700 to 1000 Hz.  What is the cause?  We can see it in near-field measurement of each driver:We have a boost in that region from the woofer which I suspect is due to baffle step.  If so, interesting that they chose to not compensate for it.  We also have a port/cabinet resonance there so the combination becomes erratic.Near-field response looks cluttered in that same region:Fortunately it looks like floor reflection makes that bump worse so by using a thick carpet, its effect can be reduced.Putting the two together, the predicted in-room response really shows this one bump and a smaller dip after it:Big or small problem?  Visually it looks kind of big, no?Forgot to note the slight bass boost around 120 Hz.  From previous testing of other speakers with that there, I think that tends to be a positive, not a negative.Get ready for a big smile when we look at horizontal beam width:Could they get this more perfect?  I don't think so.  It is almost a flat line.  Not only that, the drop off is just as organized as you see in pink and green lines.  I don't think we have seen studio monitors this good.Same is reflected in our contoured plot:Vertically naturally is not as perfect but still a lot better than many 2-way non-coaxial speakers:Zooming into three frequencies, we see very good behavior as far as 3-D dispersion:Crossover frequency is 1.6 kHz by the way.When it comes to distortion, at 86 dB the 4309 is just cruising:Even at 96 dBSPL, it keeps bass distortion from going through the roof.Impedance is typical in the way it drops to 4 ohm:JBL 4309 Listening Tests and EqualizationI listened to the 4309 without looking at the measurements first.  I thought the overall sound was just fine.  I then computed the response and was surprised at the bump around 1 kHz.  Couldn't figure out why it was not bothering me.  So I developed an EQ for it and the dip after it:The effect was so subtle that I had to resort to blind testing of the EQ to be sure it was making a positive difference.  And it was but very subtle in the way it improved clarity.  And perhaps reduced a touch of sharpness.  But really, you could listen either way and still very much enjoy the sound of this speaker.Where the 4309 really excelled was power handling.  I pumped a ton of power into it and it kept getting louder and louder with no hint of distortion.  I could not believe it.  There is some magic tuning going on here in the way this speaker can produce nice tactile bass yet not fall apart when you asking to produce more and more until you give up before it does!  I don't think there is a bookshelf speaker that can compete with it in this regard.  You should have heard it thundering away despite me just playing a single speaker!Back to the sound, half way through my listening tests, I started to enjoy the sound so much that I forgot I was reviewing them!  I was just enjoying track after track and settling into the music.  Audiophile life as it should be!  ConclusionsI like to think we know a lot about evaluating the sound of a speaker objectively and then comes a speaker like this were we can clearly identify flaws but somehow other nice characteristics of the speaker dominate so much that the issue becomes lost in a sea of goodness.  Here, the perfect directivity and power handling plus what seems to be nice tonality carry the day.  If I had just seen the measurements, I would have given this speaker lower score.  But once I listened and judged the impact of the response error using EQ, it pushed me to give it very high regards.  My definition of technology at its best is that it doesn't make you work around its limitations and such is the story of the 4309.It is my pleasure to give high recommendation to JBL 4309.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I purchased my sample from Amazon and it cost US $149 including Prime shipping.  This speaker also seems to be the favorite of youtube bloggers, helped partly by generous seeding of such ""reviewers."" The RB42 looks stunningly good for such a budget price if you stand a bit far:Curved cabinet with excellent fit and finish that would be at home (if it were a larger cabinet) in a high-end audio shop.Zoom in though and you see that budget pricing doesn't get you perfection:I don't know what the two white dots are.  They would not come off easily.   The lousy gluing job of the dust cap encourages one to put them far from eyesight. The back panel impresses again with nice binding posts:If you didn't tell me in advance and I did not look closely, I would have thought these are $400 to $500 speakers.Measurements of the Micca R42 were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics) to subtract room reflections.

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:There are lots of peaks and valleys in the on-axis (black) and listening window (dashed green) indicating everything you play with be EQed to that tune.  The excessive energy from a few thousand hertz and up indicates this will be a ""bright"" sounding speaker which may impress people at first listening (""great resolution and imaging"") but becomes tiring quickly.The boost in 200 to 300 Hz is a common technique to give the impression of more bass than there really is.Since the speaker was driven with 2.83 volts signal, we can directly read the sensitivity from the frequency response graph.   Depending on what region you use and what averaging you perform, you get something in 80 to 85 dB which is within the manufacturer specs.Zooming into the difference between our direct sound and what travels around the room gives us high level of non-uniformity:This means two things:1. You can't EQ these regions because EQ can't just fix the reflections that have different tonality than direct sound.  It changes both so the net gain is zero.2. Speaker will sound different in different rooms.  So while you may swear it sounds great for you, it may very well not for an other person with different room/environment.If you were to use these in far-field, i.e. normal stereo listening away from desk, this is the response you can expect to see:Hard to know where to draw that line.  Regardless, you will have a very uneven frequency response.So overall, this is far from even and neutral response that you would like to have in a speaker.  Listening impressions at the end.Speaker Impedance MeasurementsThere is a pretty low dip in impedance making this speaker rather hard to drive when combined with its low efficiency:Distortion MeasurementsI have no way of verifying the correctness of these distortion measurements but here they are:These are all in-room measurements of my large garage.  Since there is no real response below 50 Hz, I would ignore that region.Advanced Speaker MeasurementsWe can see how the woofer starts to ""beam"" (narrow its output cone) around 2 kHz before the tweeter takes over with its wider directivity (cone):Spin data is enclosed.Speaker Listening TestsI evaluated the Micca RB42 on a 5 inch stand on my desk since that is likely how it will get used.  I powered it using the Purifi amplifier. I was pleased that I had not shaved as the sharp highs nicely took care of any facial hair I had!  This thing is bright.  It also gets distorted quickly.  If you see the woofer flapping around, it is distorted. Toeing it out did not help much.  What did help a bit was me plugging the port using my hand.  I should test it that way and see what difference it makes. I guess it is better than any plastic computer speaker.  But if you are here to find something that produces proper sound, the RB42 is not it.ConclusionsIf something sounds bright to my aging ears, you better believe it is bright.  I am surprised the online bloggers like this speaker as they are younger than me so they likely hear more of the high-pitched tones out of this.  At times this was so bad I had sit farther back! I suggest getting a powered studio monitor instead of these.  You don't have to an amplifier for them and those that I have tested have far better objective and subjective response.Net, net, the Mica RB42 is very well built as far as the cabinet and such, but when it comes to sound, it is not something I can recommend.That said, the night is young and we don't have much data on other bookshelf speakers like it.

I purchased it new a couple of months ago thank to generous partial funding from a member.  The EVO 4.1 costs US $799.I chose walnut among the few colors it comes in:As you see it uses AMT tweeter in a 2-way configuration.  A passive radiator fires into the stand and air jets out the to sides.  Back panel shows nice sized binding posts:Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was the center of AMT driver (aligned by eye).  It is getting colder with the measurement room temp at 15 degrees C.Wharfedale EVO 4.1 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:We see a rather stepped response.  Bass is shelved down, then we get to midrange that is rather flat but then there is a wide and large resonance center around 3.8 kHz.  Close up measurements of the radiating surfaces shows the reason for the latter:Since it is in the crossover region, seems to me they could have pulled that down by adjusting the filter/crossover point but they chose not to do so.Use of passive radiator means that internal resonances are not radiating out so good to see that.Back to our spin graph, off-axis response rapidly drops off in upper treble which we can clearly see impacting early window reflections:The tall AMT tweeter is beaming (surface too large relative to frequency being produced) causing that sharp drop off.  This will be a recurring theme in measurements to follow including our predicted in-room response:The resonance is quite prominent.  But what is the effect of room reflections contributing up to 8 kHz but then sharply less so past that?Let's quantify the beaming using our beam width graph:We have reasonable directivity for a while but then physics takes over and beam width narrows logarithmically with frequency (shown as a line here since horizontal axis is in log).  Below that beam width is a bit larger than usual so the imaging would be more diffused around the speaker (good thing in small speakers in my opinion).Our contour map shows what we already know:The AMT tweeter is taller than it is wider so beams even more in that direction:With such a narrow directivity I would normally say ""stay at tweeter axis"" but in this case, I probed to see if any other response is better with respect to resonance and there is:10 degrees is not much though so I am not sure it matters in practice.Distortion is typical of speakers in this size and class:Tweeter resonance seems to also be responsible for distortion in the 2 to 4 kHz.  So would have definitely been nice if that was fixed in the design.For fans of timing domain analysis, here are the impulse and CSD/waterfall graphs:Edit: forgot the impedance graph:Wharfedale EVO 4.1 Listening Tests and EqualizationOnce in a while it is good to have a ""control"" to see if these ears are operating to spec.  I started playing the EVO 4.1 and was surprised that I heard no brightness at all! If anything there was good bit of bass emphasis.  I walked up to the speaker and put my ear next to AMT tweeter and as I expected, it was not playing.  In the process of moving the speaker from measurement lab to listening room and tightening the bi-wire post, one had moved out of position so tweeter was disconnected.  The woofer plays high enough frequency that the tweeter not being there did not have an immediate effect.  But man, did putting it in the circuit did.  There was dramatic amount of high frequency content and brightness.Let me say as always that this kind of ""showroom sound"" does have a short term preferential effect.  The sound is hyper detailed and since it only impacts lower treble, it is not overly hissy and lispy.  But you do ""hear into the recording"" like nobody's business.  On female vocals the focus on their voice becomes extreme as if their face is poking through the middle of the speaker.  It requires a lot of discipline and understanding the unnaturalness of this sound to get you want to tame it and tame I did:Once I pulled the resonances though, I thought I lost some sparkle so dialed a bit back in upper register per hole in the frequency response.  Tonality was now more natural but I kept thinking the sound was a bit tubby.  Just didn't like the bass for some reason.  I decided to pull down the upper bass with that broad filter and that fixed the issue.  I was throwing away too much of the response so I pushed the overall level a few notches to improve gain.Once there, the sound was OK and maybe fine but I just couldn't enjoy it.  Maybe it needs more surgery with EQ.  Maybe it is the directivity.  Either way, I could get into it.I tested for sub-bass response.  While many speakers in this class don't play it, the EVO 4.1 does but severely distorts it at medium to high levels.  So best to use a high-pass filter.At this point I stood back pondering if it is me that doesn't like the sound as the overall response is not that bad.  So turned off EQ, listened for a few minutes but then quickly switched to Revel M16.  Oh wow, what a revelation.  The sound was so much warmer yet I could hear nice high frequency detail.  The improvement was dramatic and not what I had expected.ConclusionsExpectations are high when you go up from a few hundred dollars and are dealing with a small bookshelf speaker.  I am afraid Wharfedale seems to have gone for marketing sound here rather than high fidelity.  There is no excuse for that resonances in treble other than to please people in short-term listening and showroom setting.  It is a shame as I think they could have corrected for it.There are some positives in the form of the passive radiator that keeps internal resonances inside the box.  And decent directivity index allowing equalization.I can't recommend the Wharfedale EVO 4.1. ----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was enough to compute the sound field of the speaker within 1% to 2% error.Temperature was 81 degrees.

Ultimately he decided that these are probably accurate.  If so it is quite uneven as you see.I could not drive the speaker beyond 80 dB SPL (naturally):Quick Speaker Listening TestMy near-field workstation area is in pieces so I initially tested the Helium far field.  Well, let me just say the sound is not right.  Tonality is wrong (muffled and boomy), and there is grittiness to sound which I did like.  I then sat in front of it while still on my normal stand and the situation improved.  But the grittiness was still there.ConclusionsI don't know how to judge this speaker any other way than I do normally which is to hold it up to the best sound one could get.  It is likely quite unfair to do that relative to the tiny size of this speaker.  I just don't have another frame of reference.  As is then, I am afraid this is a failing attempt.  I hope the designer uses this information to refine the product and produce a follow up with better performance.  Having something small but very high quality would be dandy.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Picked probably 30 pounds of tomatoes today.

It was kindly loaned to me by a local member.  The LS50 costs US $1,500 but seems to be on sale for US $1,300 on Amazon and elsewhere.The LS50 nails the look of the speaker with the bright color and shape of the concentric driver:80% of the success of a speaker in this super crowded market is the industrial design and KEF nails that.  The enclosure itself feels like it is solid all the way to its core!Not much exciting on the back other than nice sized speaker terminals and a port that has benefited from good simulations:My company became a KEF dealer for a short period of time when the LS50 had just come out.  We set it up with a Revel sub optimized for the room with DSP and it sounded good in our little room.  Since then I have heard it at shows but no opportunity for careful analysis of it.Of course there are tons of reviews and measurements of the LS50.  The idea of us testing it is to have a reference set of measurements using the same system (Klippel NFS) and graphics as I present for other speakers.Measurements were performed at around 57 degrees at elevation of 14 feet above sea level.  All scents were neutralized in the lab as to eliminate their effect on measurements (had to take a shower myself).  To make sure the system was ready for precise results, a five axis laser convolvometer was used to determine the acoustic center of the speaker.  Independent lab data is available for the calibration system on request.Spinorama Speaker MeasurementsOur ""bible"" for how a speaker may sound based on measurements it the spinorama as standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 standard:Focusing on the on-axis graph (in black) and its close relative, the listening window (dashed green line), we see that there is a good sized drop in bass frequencies between 50 and 150 Hz.  Post crossover there is a boost in mid-frequencies starting at 2.2 kHz.  The ideal here is a flat line and unfortunately we don't have it.Good news is that the reflections as represented by the dashed blue line has less variation in it so be sure to let those play out instead of covering your walls with absorbers.Predicted in-room response assuming you let the reflections be therefore looks like this:Doesn't look too bad other than the droop in low bass.In summary, you are going to have somewhat anemic bass with some exaggerations of frequencies.Basic Speaker MeasurementsThe impedance chart is presented to figure out if the amplifier is ""difficult"" to drive and hence requires beefy amplification:Lowest impedance above 20 Hz is at 216 Hz.  Phase angle is high at the same time so that is a difficult load although music energy is also rather low there.At 40 Hz where a lot of music peaks are the impedance is higher to above 10 Ohm (good).  Below it though we dip back down to 5 ohms or less.Sensitivity is specified at 85 dB at 1 meter/2.83 volts.  We get:At mid-frequencies we get there.  But in bass, you drop way down to some 75 dB.  So don't go running standard calculators online on how loud a speaker gets based on the 85 dB one.  Bass is where it is at and there, you need tons more power than 85 dB would indicate.Advanced Speaker MeasurementsFor people who like to spend hours on measurements, here is all you need to pass that time.Let's start with contour plots.  In previous measurements, I showed them at 5 degree resolution.  If we are going to measurebate, might as well go out with 1 degree granularity to put to shame anyone measuring speakers at 10 degree increments manually!  ​Here is the waterfall/""CSD"" graph using the same scale as I presented in my last review.​Distortion MeasurementsThese are all in-room measurements at the same SPL as the spinorama measurements:Here is the same data but presented in the more familiar THD ratio/percentage:High frequency polar plotI went up and down the frequency range to find anything interesting to find but there wasn't any. The coaxial driver nicely generates a balloon of sound even around crossover region.  I thought we must have some eye candy though so I thought I present this plot at 20 kHz:Science can be beautiful!  Unlike the typical measurements performed, we have a full 3-D scan of the speaker radiation so we can present graphs like this with high resolution to show all their details.A bit on the useful side, the same info plotted in 2-D (inset) shows that our acoustic center (tweeter) matches the measured acoustic center.Really, really informal listening testsI had just listened to the Harbeth M30 speakers so I thought I swap the two and listen to the same tracks.  Well, this was a let down.  There was no bass to speak of.  Turning up the volume resulted in distortion as I could visibly see the little woofer trying to keep up.  Definitely not a good choice for a large space.  A subwoofer with proper EQ is well advised.  Overall, I could not get excited over the sound I was getting.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Bought on rack to store speakers on.

I purchased this through my company and it arrived a few days ago.  Can't tell you my cost , but retail price is US $900 (sold $450 each).  As you can expect, when you pay more, you do get more as far as overall look and finish of the speaker:No fasteners, finish that let you read your smartphone against, etc.  Curved sides lead to the back panel:Large curved port and quality binding posts.Disclaimer: Before I get into this review, and at the risk of stating the obvious, I have a million conflicts of interest here.  I am a long time friend and professional colleague with a number of Harman employees (parent company of Revel).  I have praised their design and research philosophy countless times.  And our company, Madrona Digital is a Harman dealer (although we hardly sell any stereo gear).  So read all the bias you want into the review but please don't go posting to complain.  Just read the measurements if you are worried and if you don't trust that, just move along.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed.  Frequency resolution is 0.7 Hz (yes, less than 1 Hz) and plots are at 20 points/octave.  Spatial 3-D resolution is 1 degree.Over 1000 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field across full frequency response of 20 to 20 kHz. Final database of measurements and data is 1.4 Gigabytes in size.  As you see below, I also made a scan using 500 points and results were identical, pointing to a well behaved soundfield that is easily to synthesize.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: At first blush it seems that the response is not flat but if you ignore the hump at 100 Hz and roll off above 10 kHz, the rest is actually pretty close to flat.  So tonality should be neutral but with some boosted bass.  The high frequency roll off was puzzling as it doesn't match Harman's measurement:As I have circled, the Harman measurements seems to be some evaluation version?  Perhaps there has been changes since?  Regardless, the rest of the measurement matches mine quite well so confidence is high in the data you see here.Above data is for a reflection-free room.  We can however simulated what happens in a typical room using Predicted in-room response which is right on the money with some bass boost: Given the bit of roll off in high frequencies, don't go putting absorbers everywhere, especially the thin ones.  We are done here.  Speaker nerds can read on though.Basic Speaker MeasurementsSpeaker phase and impedance shows one resonance which shows up in other measurements including our spinorama shown above:You can see it here as well:The crossover is at 2.1 kHz and we see rising distortion prior to that.  Seems like the woofer is breaking up before its shift is over.Everybody get ready to say ""oooh"" as I post the pretty waterfall graph:I know, not as exciting in person.....Advanced Speaker MeasurementsYou can tell someone was making sure that the sound you hear reflected horizontally is just as perfect as the on-axis direct sound:You paid for it, might as well use it so don't cover the sidewalls.  Let the speaker use them to present a larger image.We have our vertical dip at extreme angles so floor and ceiling should be covered if the room is not too dead already:That would reduce the dip in vertical axis around crossover region as marked.Sitting a bit to the side (not as much toe-in) fixes that little hump around 5 kHz:Eye-candy Speaker MeasurementsOur horizontal directivity plot shows that this speaker has similar tonality to +- 60 degrees and rolls of very smoothly:Note that the above has 1 degree spatial resolution so much, much more detailed image than what you see even coming out of anechoic chamnbers.Speaker Listening TestsI first started testing the M16 on my desktop in near-field listening, comparing it to cheap Pioneer SB-22 speaker (levels matched, one speaker at a time).  The Pioneer just wasn't in the same class.  It sounded tinny and small compared to Revel.  Pushing the M16 hard, I could get the small woofer to distort.  Since this is not a near field monitor, I decided to test it in my 2-channel system as I have tested other hi-fi speakers.  Here is what that looks like:Sitting next to its much bigger brother, the Revel Salon 2, it seems that the M16 won't have a chance.  Boy, is that the wrong conclusion.  Vocal fidelity in both male and female tracks was excellent.  Such balance and what I focused on when I took the blind test at Harman.  And then these delightful highs would come with such clarity and freedom of distortion/coloration that would melt me in my chair.  I sat there going through my reference tracks, one by one, and almost all sounded superb.  Despite only one speaker playing, if you closed your eyes, you absolutely heard a ""soundstage"" as if there were two speakers playing and creating a large phantom image.  Yes, the bass at times was a bit much.  And max SPL was not there.  But boy, was it close to my much larger speakers for general enjoyment.  I usually play half a dozen tracks and I am done testing speakers but not here.  I could not stop.ConclusionsIf you want to have a taste of what all of Harman research and engineering is about, get a pair of M16s and listen.  They are delightful ""bookshelf"" speakers showing what can be done when you combine serious research with a decent budget for pats and manufacturing.Truth to be told, I tried, I really tried to give the M16s the middle of the road award so that I would not be accused of bias.  But at the end, I just could not.  These are wonderful sounding speakers.  It is what ""high-end"" sound reproduction is about in smaller budget.  The combination of measurements and subjective listening impressions left me to no room but to give them my highest award (in the context of a small, lower cost speaker).Needless to say, I am happy to recommend the Revel M16 speakers.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Had to ask my guy who does yard work to come and do what I should be doing there, instead of testing audio products.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Good grief.  Look at how the two drivers are crossed with that giant dip.  It seems to me this is on-purpose as all they had to do was to set the crossover frequencies a bit different and the hole would not be this deep.  They must think what sells is bass and treble, and damn everything else in the middle.  Directivity (on and off-axis similarity) looks very good though.  In theory then, that dip would be one we can fill in with equalization.This would not be a Klipsch speaker without some terrible peaking although the amount is rather mild here compared to what they could do.  Likewise, they publish fantasy stories about sensitivity.  As I note, in bass frequencies where you need sensitivity, you still need tons of power.  But maybe the highs bother you so much you won't want to turn it up that much!Predicted in-room response tells us what we already (for good and bad);Because on and off-axis response is similar, we get the same shape graph as our spinorama on-axis with a bit of tilt down which we can all appreciate.Early reflections all have the same dip as noted repeatedly:On many speakers, on-axis is flat in this region and it is off-axis that causes the dip.  Here all axis have the same hole.Impedance predictably dips a lot lower than Klipsch lets on:Distortion shows that the woofer is starting to suffer before it is retired by the tweeter:So maybe that is the reason for not pulling its response up higher?  Nah.  They wanted this kind of response.I let you hunt around for resonances in the waterfall:Story is already told on directivity but here are the pretty graphs anyway:Speaker Listening TestFor those of you bothered by these remarks, please skip to the conclusions.  Don't want you to suffer needlessly....I powered the Klipsch RP-600M using my main system (amplification 1000+ watts).  I was expecting bad sound but man, this is really, really bad sound.  No detail.  Muddy bass and somewhat but not extremely bright.  I dial in my room mode bass correction and that helps a tiny bit but suffering continues as I go to track after track.Testing the theory that the crossover dip can be repaired with EQ, I dialed that in using Roon parametric EQ.  And while I was at it, I pulled down the extreme highs as well.  This is the end result:The yellow filter above fixing the hole was stunning!  It transformed the speaker into a completely different device.  Back was the detail, and beautiful vocals.  Our hearing is the most sensitive in 2 to 5 kHz so you don't want a speaker pull down that area or you lose detail.   There was a trade off in making the sound a bit bright if you push the Gain higher.  Still, it sounded good up to 5+ dB of boost.The roll off was mostly good but too crude.Normally I don't suggest letting automated room EQ fix the speaker but in this case, I would let it beat it into shape.My quick fixes were good enough for me to sit there and want to enjoy some tracks of music!  I pity on people who buy this speaker with no means of EQ.ConclusionsOut of the box, the Klipsch RP-600M throws out the rule book, thinking that if you just sold boosted lows and highs and leaving mids behind is a good idea.  It is not.  Objective and subjective testing shows this to be a horrible choice ranking the speaker as one of the worst I have tested.  Dial in some simple EQ though and the speaker transforms into a beauty.  The ""horn"" is actually not a horn but a waveguide that is doing its job to provide uniform off-axis response allowing one to EQ the mid-range dip.Since I have to score the speaker as designed, it gets my worst rating of ""stay away.""  If you have ability to EQ, and you better do if you are hanging around this forum, then you have a good offering.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Cabin fever is getting to me despite glorious sunshine outside.

This was ground breaking research by Sean Olive published back in 2004 with the goal of predicting listener preference using anechoic chamber speaker measurements.  Seemed like an impossible task but Sean pulled it off going beyond people's intuition that ""everyone prefers a different sound.""  Clearly if we can predict preference based on measurements, then it is listener independent.As we dug into the research, we quick ran into niggling problems with specificity of the standard/measurement computations, lack of clarity in some areas, etc.  I don't think anyone had zoomed in and analyzed the research remotely as much as we have done across so many reviews.  Still, replicating the research impossible due to the need for controlled double blind testing.  One thing we can do however, is see if we can at least replicate the anechoic chamber results.To be ""polite"" the research did not list actual speaker names/models.  Fortunately they reference the Consumer Reports magazine test that triggered this research (Harman speakers did not do well in that despite winning listening tests).  Member @napilopez beat me to the punch and got a copy of the old Consumer Reports magazine that had the list of speakers.  See: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ce-ratings-for-loudspeakers.11091/post-412375On top of that list as far as the bookshelf speaker that produced the highest preference score was a long discontinued Infinity Interlude IL10.

This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsLet's start with our measurements first:This is nice!  Response is more or less flat until about 10 kHz with a couple of resonances (peaks) here and there.  This is what was reported in Sean Olive's paper:  A Multiple Regression Model For Predicting Loudspeaker Preference Using Objective Measurements: Part I-Listening Test Results   Sean E. Olive, AES Fellow Note that they used a 70 dB scale for the vertical axis of the spinorama measurements which compresses things relative to 50 dB which we use (and complies with the standard).  There is no question that our measurements match theirs proving that we are dealing with the same speaker as ""L1.""  Note the jagginess in the low frequency response from Harman.  That indicates room modes interfering with the measurement in low frequencies.  In contrast, my measurements are smooth as silk, not suffering from any reflections.  On the other hand, there is a bit of jagginess in the midfrequencies that is caused by the microphone ""cage"" that I am using which doesn't show up as much in Harman's measurements.  So I think we can expect some numerical differences between their data and ours.The mean for the listening score of the Harman panel was 6.16 (highest of any speaker).  Other than lack of bass, it achieved almost perfect neutrality scores as shown in the bottom graphs for different frequency ranges.Here is our early window measurements:Quit close to direct axis resulting in a predicted response that is well, very predictable in a good way!Depending on where I draw the line, there is some excess energy but overall, very good showing and a sign of a speaker that is neutral.  The horizontal ""beam width"" shows the speaker to be on the narrow side than wide:But it is smooth otherwise as it falls off:Here is vertical:Not the focus of our study here but for completeness here is the impedance and phase:And waterfall:The research found that level of distortion did not correlate with preference in the face of frequency response variations.  But let's examine them anyway:There is definitely an issue between 1 and 2 kHz even at lower volume of 86 dB.Here is the absolute level at 96 dB:Closely measuring each individual component we get:Seems like our peak around 600 Hz is a resonance inside the box escaping through the port as circled (someone should do the math).  Speaker Listening TestsFor me this was the heart of the project: how would I like the best preferred speaker in this test?  I fired up the speaker and my ""5 second impression"" was good.  This speaker sounded neutral.  Female vocals were especially nice.  Try as I might though, i could not like this speaker.  Again, tonality was right but there is this grunginess and lack of clarity to everything it played.  I tried to take the resonances out to fix it but at the end, it was not conclusive, nor did it make much of a difference.  I even pulled my wife over to listen and she said there was some small difference with EQ but not enough for her to care.Frustrated, I pulled up the Revel M16 which I reviewed a while back.  Wow, what a difference.  Smooth ask silk.  Clean as clean can be.  Tonality was similar mind you but boy did it sound nice compared to IL10.Now, there are two possibilities here:1. Placebo effect and the M16 being similar to IL10.2. My brain is forever transformed to listen to distortions in small notes.  Right after tonality, this is what I listen for in speakers.  The research used such different speakers with some so broken that clearly the mid goes for tonality difference.  Combine that with the fact that unless one is trained, hearing distortion is difficult and you or at least I arrive at the fact that distortion matters once you take care of tonality.  ConclusionsThere are none as yet.  I expect this to be a living research thread where we discuss what we have found here, and whether we can better rationalize speaker preference from measurements.  The preference score for this speaker will be high (@MZKM will post shortly) putting me once again at odds with it.  We have to figure out why before I lose all face.  For now, I don't recommend that you go and chase this speaker unless you are interested to research it as I did.  Note that the speaker was cheap but shipping was a killer.And oh, I also ordered a Bose 141 which got one of the worst ratings.  It too was cheap with high shipping costs.  Will be here next week.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Now here I go from just testing gear to conducting ""research.""

We have some peaking around 100 Hz but then a broad dip up to 700 Hz.  There is another dip around crossover region of 3 kHz.  Tweeter is beaming due to lack of waveguide as you will see later. Efficiency is low averaging around 83 dB (by eye) so you need a lot of power to drive this speaker.Port resonance is not an issue but woofer seems to be running out of steam before tweeter takes over:Early window reflections show the results of tweeter narrowing:And here is the combined, predicted response:Horizontal beam width shows the uneven directivity of the woofer and tweeter:I have shown a secondary upward arrow to show the physics of beam width reducing in size as frequencies get smaller (relative to size of the tweeter).  Same is seen in contour graph:Vertical response shows more degrees of freedom than some other 2-way speakers:Distortion is good at 86 dBSPL:Finally, impedance at nearly 7 ohm should be easy for any amp to drive (that has the power this speaker needs):Speaker Listening TestsGarden season has started and with me spending a lot more time outside during fruit tree blossoming, my ears are fully plugged today.  I did a quick listen and could hear the effect of bass boost around 100 Hz since I also have a room mode there.  Lowering that peaked not only helped with a bit of boominess but also resulted in more clarity upstream indicating lowering of distortion.

It was kindly sent to me for testing by a member and costs US $499 on Amazon including Prime shipping.I like the distinctive white face of the BR03 but don't care much for the imitation white oak enclosure:The dual ports and distance above woofer, push up the tweeter higher than other speakers I have tested, landing it above my ear height.  I had to sit up during my listening tests to compensate.Binding posts on the back were comfortable to use since they were not recessed:One online blogger raved about this speaker back in 2019 causing it to become quite popular.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: That's an interesting frequency response.  A bit boosted around 100 Hz, then down and then boosted again between 500 and 1000 Hz.  Then a few more resonances, ending with some peaking from the tweeter.  Some kind of discontinuity exists around 1190 Hz and then again near 20 kHz.  Not worried about the latter but the rest needs investigation so let's look at the near-field response of the driver:Focusing on woofer curve in red, it starts to slope down but then goes right back up???  The port is pushing it that way but I can't help but think that they are using a first order electrical filter for the woofer so letting it play for much longer than it should.  That in turn hypes up the resonances from the port.  Together they screw up the response in the mid-range and lower treble.  The tweeter lacks even response by itself.Early window response is not too bad:Floor bounce seems to accentuate the highs (!) and the 600 to 900 Hz so best to use a thick carpet as indicated.Predicted in-room response shows a mellowing of the aberrations we have seen:Would the slightly boosted upper bass help offset the accentuated highs?  Hard to say.  Distortion data points to woofer playing for longer than it should:But overall, the levels are under control at 86 dBSPL:Horizontal beamwidth is good:Resonances make the contour more choppy however:Typical of 2-way non-coaxial speakers, you need to keep the tweeter more or less at ear level:As usual, actual impedance is lower than advertised:Finally, here is the waterfall:Triangle Borea BR03 Listening TestsFirst impression was warm sound and ""this is not bad.""  Whether influenced by measurements or actual sound, I just was not a fan of the midrange.  It sounded more and more grungy as I listened.  And the highs started to stand out.  A bit of boominess was there as well.  Equalization was not effective.  In blind testing, I could not tell if I always liked the post EQ version.In truth, I cannot tell you by listening that this speaker is bad or good.  It really frustrated me.  Usually I am pretty comfortable teasing out whether the fidelity of the speaker is good or not.  But with EQ experiments failing, I just could not get there.  I changed speakers to Revel M106 and as usual, that speaker delighted with a far more clean sound and balanced tonality.  It had deeper, cleaner bass compared to the slightly boomy one on the Triangle.I should point out that the BR03 was rather efficient and could play very loud without bottoming out.ConclusionsI don't have any for you!  This speaker busted my chops.  I think it is a flawed design by it is broken in a way that creates a more pleasing sound than one would expect.  Not sure if this is by design or what.  Or whether it is my failing in characterizing it.  You have the data.  You chime in as to what you think.Overall, I am not going to recommend the Triangle Borea BR03.

It is kindly sent to me by a member.  I think the SB2 came out back in 2002 when NHT was a different company than it is now (it closed and re-opened as a direct to consumer company).  At the time, the SB2 cost US $400 for a pair.The fit and finish of the SB2 is quite nice:This is a super sturdy cabinet with no ports.  It has a ""piano black"" coating which gives it a higher-end feel.  The tweeter is a bit cheesy looking though and lacks a waveguide for good integration with the woofer.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.At the risk of creating grief for people using my spinorama measurements , this is a higher resolution (in frequency domain) scan.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: Sadly we have a lot of flaws.  Frequency response is anything but flat with share of both peaks and dips and elevated high end.  Not a good idea to apply this EQ to everything you play.  Above is similar to a much more crude measurement by another site:https://www.soundandvision.com/content/war-little-worlds-first-place Sensitivity is all over the place (depending on frequency) but is probably around 82 dB which is pretty low.  Company says it is 86 dB.The SB2 is the purple graph which shares the same ups and downs as my measurements.  As an aside, they gave it the best score of the speakers they had rounded up for their testing.Off-axis response is also odd-shaped:Leading to a predicted in-room response with an uneven response:Directivity plot shows how the woofer and tweeter don't meet each other with the same sound cone size at crossover frequencies:The larger sin though is the uneven response.Vertical response is bad but that is more often than not the case:NHT says the nominal impedance is 8 ohm but your amp better be able to drive 4 ohm load:Distortion when compensated for room effects is higher than I like to see in mid-frequencies where our hearing is very sensitive:Note that per suggestion from members, I ran these distortion tests at 86 dB instead of 96 dB that I use for larger speakers.Interesting that distortion rises around the same peaking of 700 to 900 Hz.  Is that the woofer breaking up?  Or is tweeter playing down that low and doing it?Some sign of the same is in the CSD/waterfall:Speaker Listening TestsI immediately cringed when I played the first track on SB2.  It was bright and just not right.  I then dialed in a quick, single filter in Roon player to pull that peak around 800 to 900 Hz:Wow, that was transformative!  Detail immediately increased due likely to removal of the distortion/resonance causing that peak.  The sound was still bright but I did not want to keep messing with it.  With just that one filter, the speaker went from bad to, ""hey, this is not half bad!""  I enjoyed my next few tracks until I stopped to post this review.Note that the SB2 is extremely inefficient.  I had to turn up the volume to levels on my 1000 watt amplifier that I rarely ever use with any speaker.  Practical efficiency is probably less than 80 dB.  Good news is that there was no break up.  The bass was unclean at higher levels but it was livable.ConclusionsNHT had quite a good reputation in its original incarnation when this speaker was release.  It is sad to see it have such poor objective performance out of the box.  Fortunately with a bit of EQ it becomes reasonable.  Build quality and sturdiness of the cabinet is likely better than anything you can get for $400 today.Overall, I can't recommend the NHT SB2.  It clearly was not designed with best goals of produce a neutral and transparent sound.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Had to plant my corn transplants in the garden.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:On axis is surprisingly good.  Yes, there are a few resonances but overall, it is quite flat.  The closes competitor to SB-C700 is the KEF LS50.  Here is its spin:Quite on even and worse than Technics.Port is tuned to lower frequency and hence creates a shelf there:Cabinet resonance around 1.4 kHz is visible but at much lower level than we see in budget ported speakers.  Still, as noted you can see it cause a dB or so peaking in on-axis response.Early window reflections have high similarity to on-axis response due to excellent directivity:There is a broad dip though which is also reflected in predicted in-room response:Beam width is wide and generally smooth:Same story with directivity:Due to coaxial driver, vertical response is almost the same:Distortion is kept in check at 86 dBSPL but gets out of control at 96 dBSPL:Impedance is on the low side but then again, this is a similar story to many small speakers:For fans of timing analysis, here are those measurements:Technics SB-C700 Listening TestsFirst impression was that the tonality was correct.  Yet track after track did not impress.  Some sounded a bit tubby, some a bit bright.  Both of these were indicated in the measurements but correcting them didn't improvement things.  So switched out the speaker with Revel M105.  Wow, oh wow!  The sound was so much more detailed, open and delightful than what I was getting out of Technics.  So I pulled out the predicted in-room response of the M105 and saw this perfection:In comparison, the SB-C700 has that broad dip.  I put in a quick and dirty boost there and improvement was substantial:I have noticed the same in countless headphone measurements.   Make this region right and the sound opens up with better detail and spatial qualities.  Now, I could sit back and enjoy the sound of the Technics!ConclusionsThe SB-C700 made quite a buzz on its release circa 2015.  Panasonics (parent of Technics) had existed TV business but was getting seriously back into audio and this was their entry.  I remember hearing it though at an audio show and walked away unimpressed.  Part of it was the poor demo but now that I have listened to it, I can see that it is so close to being an excellent speaker.  Objectively it is far better than KEF LS50 which has run away with this market that could have been Panasonic's.  Sadly I think the SB-C700 is being discontinued, likely due to zero marketing.As is, even though objective performance is very good, I personally can't recommend the Technics SB-C700.

Aside from that we also see a lot of little peaks that indicate resonances.  You can see the source of some in the near-field response of the radiating elements:That tall resonance peak from the port around 850 Hz is unfortunate.  I also can't figure out why the port is tuned so low.  Would it not be better to be tuned a bit higher so that it provides more support for upper frequencies that are sagging right now?Early window response shows some additional issues:Combined we are going to have a bass-shy, bright speaker:Normally we like to see that arrow point down almost 10 dB.  Here it is hardly doing so which means perceptual effect would be one of brightness.The little woofer distorts a lot as well:Directivity story is good though:Here is our impedance:Dips to below 3 ohm so better have a decent amplifier.MartinLogan 4i Speaker Listening TestsI always start with my female vocals.   For all of two seconds the sound was OK and then became so jarring and sharp.  High pitched as you can get.  And not clean either.  Switching to bass heavy tracks resulted in no reproduction of lower notes resulting the overall volume noticeably going down.  Boosted the bass a bit with EQ which helped tonality but the terrible fidelity of the highs remained so I gave up.ConclusionsMartin Logan marketing material talks a lot about them bringing down the sound of their electrostatic speakers to these boxed units.  Well, if this is the sound of their electrostatic speakers, heaven help them all!  The 4i is basically a pretty screech box.  OK, I am being a bit harsh.  But just a little.

What on earth is that?  It reminds me of Pinocchio's nose!  I know Klipsch is known for bright highs but must we also throw in all those resonances as indicated by peaks that show up in all four upper graphs? Since we fed the speaker 2.83 volts for measurements, the frequency response also becomes the sensitivity graph.  We see that during much of the low spectrum were most of the music energy is, sensitivity is at 85 dB.  It only gets to 90 dB during those terrible highs.  So don't make the mistake of thinking this is an efficient speaker, it is not.Direcitivty index graph needs to be smooth to allow us to fix the frequency response anomalies we see above but it is not:Predicted in-room response fortunately is not as bad as on-axis:The hotness of the tweeter wears off when not listened to on-axis, improving the response some.  Still nothing to write home about unless you want this type of EQ applied to every piece of music you play.  The people who incorrectly think everyone's taste in speakers is different can perhaps explain why some people may want every note around 1 kHz in their music to be exaggerated. So we are done with how this speaker is going to ""sound.""  It is going to sound very bright and uneven on-axis (speaker pointed at your ears).  Toed out it will sound better but the measurements say avoid this speaker.Basic Speaker MeasurementsImpedance measurements show that the Klipsch spec of 8 ohms is a fantasy:Response dips dangerously close to a short at 300 Hz or so.  You better have a lot of amplification power there especially since sensitivity is low there as well.There are a lot of kinks and such that indicate issues which I am not bothering to outline.  They are also (potentially) visible in the waterfall measurements:Then again we saw them so clearly in frequency response measurements including that 1 kHz peak.Step function shows a kink as the tweet to woofer transition showing poor crossover design:Continuing our low quality measurements we get to distortion:Advanced Speaker MeasurementsEye-candy Speaker MeasurementsI went up to 18 kHz where only the tweeter is playing and got this wonderful confirmation of how well our instrumentation is working:You can easily see the shape of the rectangular ""horn.""Dropping down to 1 kHz where we had that peak shows some ugliness:This is a side view.  Can't figure out if this is some mixing of driver and its port of the sides singing along.This is the kind of analysis that Klipsch should be doing, not us!Speaker Listening TestsEven though this is not a near-field monitor, I tested it that way.  So shoot me!   On my right I had the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR  and on the left the Klipsch R-41M.  With levels matched and playing one channel at a time, the R-41M had no bass.  It was all mid to highs.  And boy, are those some highs.  If you have not shaved, they are sharp enough to do that for you.  I can see without a reference an inexperienced listener would instantly like them as ""more clear, more detail, better imaging, etc.""  Switch to Pioneer though and you hear such a balance in tonality.  Bass is there and overall sound is warm and pleasant.  Not so with R-41MFolks, I suffer with bad sound so you don't have to.  Please avoid the Klipsch R-41M unless you just want a speaker as an ornament.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Finally having a few dry days so have to run out to fix our green house which got torn up with the winter storms.

It was purchased by a member and kindly had it shipped to me from Japan.  He is an expert on these older JBL speakers so I am sure he will fill us in better than I can.  Form a bit of research I did, I think the speaker came out in late 1980s and cost US $699.  It is of course discontinued now but apparently the series is sought after.I must say, this an attractive looking speaker with its grill off:There is some kind of fabric/valuer material that surrounds the tweeter area.  It looks better in person than the picture above, giving a feeling of professional but nice attention to detail.The back panel is interesting:Can you see it?  Let me zoom in:Yes, they used monster cable inside!  Given the popularity of monster cable then, it kind of makes sense given JBL's aim to sell these as hifi speakers.Speaker is quite dense and solid by the way.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:The response starts well with nearly ruler flat to above 1 kHz.  But then it gets some ups and downs including around crossover region of 3 kHz.  Lack of a waveguide causes some directivity error there as well (on-axis response varying from off-axis).   There is also some peaking above 10 kHz.Early (important) reflections are more or less the same:Giving us a predicted in-room response that we could have guessed:A bit of room gain as noted, may help push up the region before a few hundred kilohertz and hence, make that not stand out.Directivity response in horizontal plan shows rather even response until 10 kHz but then the tweeter ""beams"" (its response becomes narrow):So if you don't toe in the speaker, it can bring down the peaking of above 10 kHz.Vertical directivity is not good (fairly typical) but you better keep the tweeter at your ear level because it gets worse otherwise:I could not hear much stress at 96 dB SPL at 1 meter so I thought distortion was under control but it was not:In hindsight, I should have also tested it at 86 dB but I didn't.   Here is the same data but as percentage:Finally, here is the impedance and phase:The 6 ohm rating from the company is optimistic.Speaker Listening TestsI must say, the first impression was positive!  And it got better from there as I disabled my single filter for my room mode.  It added good bit of nice clean bass.  I think the positive impression was the result of smooth and flat response to above 1 kHz.  I listen for detail and bloatedness in that range and the flat response kept that in check.I experimented with a few filters based on spin data.  Only the first filter was successful across all content:This filled that hole in the frequency response, resulting in better detail.As I noted, I dealt with toe-in to tame the brightness.  Quick filters to do the job was were too crude so I gave up on them.  Ditto for filling in the crossover error.Overall, the strength of the speaker was in vocals, and simpler instruments.  You know, the classic audiophile tracks .  So I can see why it has the popularity that it has.ConclusionsI think this is the first speaker I have liked that has some clear response errors.  What it gets right must be what I pay attention to and in that regard, this was an enjoyable speaker.If you want to go back to the times were speakers were built in US without trying to squeeze every penny out of the cost as we have today, these may be your best bet.Overall, I am happy to recommend the JBL XPL90 speakers.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.My back is killing me from digging ditches after ditches to plant tomatoes (some 60 plants).

I purchased the set for this review from Amazon for US $199 including free shipping.The 220 comes with inset covers for each driver, giving it a classy look despite its low cost.  Here it is though without the grills:The top driver is just a tweeter with the surrounds being a waveguide.  It is not a coaxial driver.  The port shoots from a hole into the secondary bottom on the speaker.The back panel is where you really notice this is a budget speaker, sans the fancy bi-amp terminals which you never see in this price range:Despite being small, the 220 is rather hefty and dense speaker.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used 800+ measurement points which resulted in error rate of slightly above 1% in upper treble frequencies.Temperature was 68 degrees. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.The reference axis is the tweeter.  As you see below, I tested the unit with the grill on and off.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws.  Let's first see the measurements with the grill on:We see quite a disturbance in all of the graphs around 5 kHz.  Looking at the driver response, we see modulations at multiples of 3 kHz in the tweeter as well:So I remeasured the speaker with the grill off:This is a huge improvement!  Usually the impact of the grill is small but here, given how close it is to the driver, its comb filtering effect is amplified.Early and important reflections indicate you should avoid floor and ceiling ones if you can:If you don't, this is the predicted response:Note that the issue is around 1.5 to 2 kHz so even a rather thin carpet would do the job (1 inch or thicker).Impedance dips low as it typically does in this type of speaker:The waveguide is doing its job in creating a rather smooth horizontal dispersion:Vertical tends to be a lot more chewed up but it is not that bad here:You are OK within a ±20 degree window above and below the tweeter axis.Edit: forgot the distortion data:Subjective Speaker ListeningOut of box experience with the Diamond 220 was very good.  There was a slight boominess that prompted me to turn on the filter for my room mode.  Past that, I decided to fill the dip in the response, and put in a shelf for the highs:And my usual high pass filter to get rid of extreme lows that just add distortion and not much more.Once there, this is a truly hifi speaker.  Every audiophile track I had whether it was female vocals, pop music, vintage jazz, etc., it all sounded very good.The 220 could also play very loud. The only problem is that the port makes very obnoxious rattling sound that doesn't come out of the woofer.  This only happens at very high volumes and you only hear it if you are close to the speaker.ConclusionsI must say, I was not prepared for this speaker to sound good.  The first measurement seemed poor and that set my context.  Yet when it was all said and done, for a budget speaker, it does a lot of things very right.  Good tonality, very good power handling, and nice looks add up to an attractive package.I am happy to recommend the Wharfedale Diamond 220 speaker. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Went to our garden and picked up the last of the zucchini and winter squash:There are so cute to look at, you almost don't want to eat them!Oh, on our septic saga.

I purchased it from Amazon and costs US $699 (a pair).We have the iconic paper white woofer.  Speaker is commonly shown the horizontal configuration as you see but I tested it vertically as you see below.  No port or anything exciting in the back:The claim to fame of the original Yamaha NS-10m was that it would allow mix/mastering engineers to create pop/rock music that ""translated"" well to whatever people were using to listen to music.  A bit of its history and anechoic measurements are documented in this excellent paper:THE YAMAHA NS10M: TWENTY YEARS A REFERENCE MONITOR.  WHY? Philip R Newell Consultant,Moaña, Spain Keith R Holland ISVR, University of Southampton, UKJulius P Newell Independent Audio Systems Engineer, UKHere are their conclusions:6. SUMMARY From the investigations presented, and from experiences in the use of the NS10M, it would appear that the following statements can be made.•The free-field frequency response of the NS10M gives rise to a response in typical use which has been recognised by many recording personnel as being what they need for pop / rock music mixing.  The principal characteristics are the raised mid-range, the gentle top-end rolloff, and the very fast low-frequency decay; the latter is aided by the 12dB / octave roll-off of the sealed-box cabinet.•The time response exhibits a better than average step function response, which implies good reproduction of transients.  Many people speak of the ""rock and roll punch"" of the NS10M. •The distortion characteristics are also better than average for a loudspeaker of such size.•The output SPL is adequate for close-field studio monitoring with adequate reliability.•In many of these characteristics, the NS10M mimics the response of many good larger monitor systems in well-controlled rooms.  They are hence recognisable to many recording personnel in terms of their overall response.•They are tools to achieve a well-balanced mix.  It is notable how many of the people who use them in studios do not use them for home listening.I tried to find a real NS-10m on various auction sites but all I found were speakers in horrible shape and still asking what this Avantone more or less costs.  Testing the old samples would not give us data on how they performed when new so made no sense to risk buying them.As noted, I chose to test the CLA-10 vertically as it was easier to set the reference point on Klippel NFS.  Otherwise I would have to shift the speaker to the right, making for an asymmetrical situation.  Fortunately this doesn't impact on-axis response and you can just transpose vertical measurements for horizontal and get that data as well (can't do that with preference score but that is not a big thing here).Tweeter center was the reference axis although it did not make much difference when I lowered it.Avantone CLA-10 Speaker MeasurementsLet's start with the anechoic measurements from the Newell, et. al. paper of the Yamaha NS-10M:We see that it has a hugely over boosted midrange to low treble.  We get that in CLA-10 but unfortunately here, the boosted response goes way higher:So assuming the paper measurements are correct, then the CLA-10 clearly is not its clone.  That aside, there is a narrow but nasty resonance around 3500 Hz.  We have a large directivity error that would have been in the Yamaha as well.  Overall, this is a horribly bad response by any measure.Strangely that resonance did not show up in near-field measurements indicating it likely is not in the drivers:Paper talks about low distortion but they measured it at 90 dBSPL so not matching mine.  But we can interpolate and kind of see what they are saying:We really need relative distortion measurements as that includes the variations in response.  Absolute levels as they show is not instructive unless speakers being compared all have flat measurements (which they do not).  Using our relative measurements, we see broad distortions where our hearing is most sensitive at 96 dBSPL.We see the strong directivity error impacting our early window reflection sum:Breaking that down we see that using the speaker as tested, i.e. vertically, is much more optimal:As noted, the pink curve which is the sound being sent to you, going past and reflecting from the wall behind you (if it is close), makes the tweeter even hotter so absorption there would help.If you placed the speaker on its side the right graph becomes your horizontal axis, emphasizing that massive error.  You better absorb the heck out of your sidewalls then (assuming they are close to the speakers).Here is our predicted in-room response:We see the effect of directivity error in our 3-D near-field plot:Level of reflections in the room will change the tonality of this speaker fair bit.Our beamwidth and directivity tell the story we already know:The paper talks about fast settling response of the Yamaha NS-10 but they use wildly different timing scale so we can't compare that to my measurements (they can do that because they have an anechoic chamber).  Here is the data anyway:So we don't just have boosted frequencies but lots of resonances within.  I think this is the worse waterfall measurement I have seen of any speaker I have tested.The paper also has a step response and here, matching to our measurements is excellent:Rating impedance of the original I think is 8 ohm and we are kind of there with CLA-10:Avantone Pro CLA-10 Speaker Listening TestsI was listening to my everyday music when I started to test the CLA-10.  When I hit play on the same track I was listening to using my headphones, I thought something was seriously wrong as all I was hearing was distorted high frequencies.  I went back to my standard test tracks and there, the sound was somewhat better but as you can imagine, had heavy treble emphasis. Not only that, it sounded grungy and bad.  I dialed in an inverse filter for the 3450 Hz resonance and that cleaned things up a bit.  From there, I built a five filter correction but the speaker still sounded quite lousy.I then took the inverse approach of boosting bass.  That was more successful but still, what I was hearing was just not great.  The sound and experience was bad that I just gave up on playing with it more.  The idea here is not to make this a hi-fi speaker anyway as the use is for mastering and everyone says it is not good for enjoyment.  On that front, they are right.I did experiment with putting in a shelving filter to bring the response close to the NS-10m and that was definitely an improvement.  So I don't think the Yamaha was nearly as bad as CLA-10 is.  I like to meet the mastering engineering who was involved the design of CLA-10 to understand how he thinks these speakers are equivalent.Discussion and ConclusionsThe data here seems clear: in attempting to clone a rather broken speaker, Avantone has made an even more broken speaker.  It fails not only in mimicking the frequency response of the NS-10M but seems to also introduce resonances that may not have been in the original.  Any attempt like this should have been done as you see above: with detailed anechoic measurements to make sure the design is a true clone of the original.  Using what is thought to be original parts and tuning based on someone's ear is just not the way to do it.The whole idea of a mix that ""translates well"" is a problematic thing.  Yeh, in the 1970s and 1980s we listened to a lot of music in cars with stock sound systems and clock radios and such at home.  Those systems were likely to have had midrange/lower treble emphasis.  That all changed with advent of iPods and people listening to headphones/IEMs that have deep bass response.  So likely what translated to old casual audio systems of the past, will not work in this era.  Why there is still interest in buying such a speaker is beyond me.I know I may be making a lot of enemies by saying this but maybe this speaker was compensating for poor listening skills of people using them.  That is, unless there was so much exaggeration in large portion of the frequency response, they couldn't tell that they had boosted them too much in the mix/mastering.The massive directivity error just adds to the problem.  No wonder folks were covering all the walls in their studios.  They couldn't stand the sound otherwise!If I were to listen to this speaker to tune a mix, I would have to turn so much of the gain from upper midrange to treble.   It is so grating otherwise.  The mix then would sound absolutely dull on any half proper audio system.  The industry needs to ditch this concept and adopt fully neutral audio systems used in mixing/mastering systems.  Then we can adopt the same and be on the same wavelength.Anyway, I am out $750 including tax so hopefully you found this analysis and measurements of value!Needless to say, I can't recommend the Avantone CLA-10 monitor.Specifications​SYSTEM TYPE: Passive - full-range two-way stereo pairFREQUENCY RESPONSE: 60Hz-20,000Hz (Accessible musical range)POWER CAPACITY: Program – 60W, Maximum – 120WSENSITIVITY: 90dB SPL (1W, 1m on axis)COMPONENTS:Low Frequency: AV10-MLF 18cm coneHigh Frequency: AV10-MHF 3.5cm soft domeCABINET: 10.4 liter sealed design, 18mm MDF with real wood veneerCABINET DIMENSIONS: 381.5mm x 215mm x197.5mm ( 15”x 8 ½”x 7- ¾ ” )CABINET WEIGHT: 6.3kg / 13.9 Lbs (each)WARRANTY: 5 Year Limited Warranty to original purchaser----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.

A member was interested in it so I decided to buy it through our company.  The retail cost is US $750 each for a total of $1,500 for a pair.NOTE: my company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and hence the Revel speakers.  So please read as much bias as you like into this review.The Revel M105 fits in the family with solid feel and very nice finish:Terminals are large and easy to manipulate which I appreciated.  I also like that the whole unit comes in cling plastic so keep it protected.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker.  Measurement axis is the tweeter and no grill was used.Temperature was 78 degrees.  Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:As noted, if you take away the one peak around 5000 Hz, measurement is essentially flat on axis.  That hump actually goes away for the most part when you look at listening axis (dashed green). Earl window response in blue is essentially flat with (proper) tilt down:This means the speaker ""illluminates"" your room with smooth response as good as the on-axis.  When this gets mixed with the direct sound, tonality doesn't change and hence my comment that the M105 is very room friendly.Put the two together and we get almost textbook perfect in our simulated room:Horizontal dispersion is wide enough that you don't have to sit there with your head in a vise:You can experiment with toe-in without tonality changing much.Here is the same in 3-D:And vertical:Impedance is on the low side so best to have good amplification that can handle low impedance loads:Here are the individual driver responses:Is our 5000 Hz hump created by the ringing/break up of the woofer as circled?The Waterfall was exceptionally clean so I lowered the floor to show more:Distortion and Non-Linearity MeasurementsLet's start with our Klippel measurements, compensated to take out room effects:Wow, this is clean!  Yes, we have low frequency distortion as displacement and motor non-linearity are not high fidelity items:Chop down that low frequency response which is not much anyway but brings boatload of distortion as it does in every other speaker we have tested.  And then you should enjoy very low distortion presentation, well below my self-imposed 50 dB threshold.Let's switch analyzers and look at multitone response:We see that distortion is decidedly lower than Behringer B2030P which I recently reviewed.  Here is the same but at the extremes of SPL:Once again we see that the distortion generator is the woofer with its larger displacement. Here is our 100 Hz tone normalized distortion products:Comparison Against Revel M106I ran a couple of tests against the M106 but frankly, I could not find a lot of differentiation:Looks like M105 has a bit more low frequency distortion.Speaker Power CompressionI refined my speaker linearity test, reducing the output frequency to 80 Hz (from 200 Hz) and measured the speakers that are still sitting around my lab:Notice that these levels don't mean the speaker is playing clean.  The Pioneer for example was super unhappy well before it got to its maximum level.  Yes, I am surprised the Revel F35 compressed earlier than bookshelves.  I don't have an explanation for that.Also, how steep the compression was differed from speaker to speaker.  The Pioneer for example looses linearity almost from the start.  Others do well then fall off a cliff.Anyway, work in progress...Speaker Listening TestsYou might think I go into these tests with a Revel speaker thinking it is going to ace the listening test.  Maybe that is so but i can tell you that I still get shocked when I start playing and I am immediately impressed by how good the tonality and level of distortion is. Maybe because I test other speakers in between and get acclimated to them.  Either way, the sound from the Revel M105 was very good.  Track after track in my playlist sounded great.As good as the sound was, I thought I apply my usual tricks with EQ and see if it could be improved:As you see, I only have two minor adjustments beside the room correction at 102 Hz.  First is one I apply to just about every bookshelf now which is a steep low frequency roll off.  At the frequency chosen, it did not at all lower the bass level or change tonality. Yet there is a distinct improvement in detail, air around instruments, etc.  I highly recommend that you try this with your speaker.The second fix was to bring that hump down.  By setting the filter to be narrow the tonality again remained the same.  Yet there was even more detail and cleaner notes.Yes, I am almost convinced that distortion is what is being reduced and it is absolutely audible to my ears.Once there, I could not stop listening.  Every track in my reference list sounded beautiful.  I am talking guitar strings that melt your audiophile heart:If tracks like this don't blow you away, you have the wrong speaker:I have not post any classic tracks because frankly, none have sounded good making me wonder why I curated them.  Then last night I played this one on the Revel and realized what an excellent, low distortion speaker it takes to make it sound good:Ars Antiqua Austria; Graupner - Concerto a 2 Chalumeaux, 2 violis Viola e Cembalo C-Dur GWV 303(high-res download from Challenge Classics)Can't find ""Vivace"" track online but here is another from the same album:ConclusionsFolks, if you are looking for a bookshelf speaker that is a neutral canvas that doesn't color everything you play and produces sublime fidelity that blows you away, the Revel M105 is your speaker.  The sound is clean, balanced, room friendly, and just delightful. As is, the sound is excellent but apply the little EQ fixes I provided and you are in absolute reference quality level of performance.Now please excuse me as I go to listen to it some more.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The Pink Panthers are demanding a summer vacation.

It took us to lug it around and with just the ports as handles, it was not easy! Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 1400 measurement which resulted in error rate of less than 1% until 10 kHz where the error started to linearly climb.  So don't go by micro detail of the response in that region.Testing temperature was around 69 degrees F.Reference axis for measurements was the center of the tweeter (by eye). Grill was not used in either measurements or listening tests.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.JBL 4349 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:I must say, I did not at all expect this kind of response from any product coming out of Harman.  The dip at the crossover?  I finished the measurements late at night and was miserable till I listened to the speaker today.   Clearly a shelving boost is implemented for the tweeter.  Fortunately if you turn the dip switches to -1, you should be able to knock that down:The big trough occurs in my measurement ""lab"" when the mic is aligned with tweeter axis.  I moved the mic down to the logo between the tweeter and woofer and the dip shrank to what you see in the spin data.  So ignore that.Back to crossover issue, here is our near-field measurement:Looks to me like the woofer response is drooping too much before the tweeter gives it a hand and hence the dip there.  Not sure if the tweeter could handle the load there.  There are also a couple of port resonances that interfere with the response.Our early window response is similar to on-axis which bodes well for ability to EQ:The dip gets worse with floor and ceiling reflections.  I am lucky in having a super thick carpet (4 inches or so) and tall ceilings. Edit: forgot the PIR graph:The star of the show is the tweeter and its directivity:Have we seen anything this pretty?  It looks textbook correct.  Shame about the crossover dip before it.Vertically, you are better off being at or below tweeter axis.  I sat below it for listening tests:An excellent supporting cast is the ultra low distortion in bass:This thing is as good as many excellent headphones at 86 dBSPL as far as distortion!Strange though to see the tweeter complain at higher amplitudes. Waterfall shows some resonances due to the port:I felt the cabinet during music and it was solid as a rock so these are acoustic ones.Finally, impedance is substantially higher than typical 2-way speaker at 8+ ohm:JBL 4349 Listening TestsI must say I was in bad, bad mood before listening tests started.  Had the bad measurements on top of killing myself dragging this speaker up to second floor where my listening test is.  Turned on the music and wow, there was hardly much to complain about!  Speaker was highly efficient and was able to pump out dynamics that were startling at times.   There was a bit of brightness despite me sitting lower than the treble so I dialed in the dip switches to -1 and -1.  Standing up I could hear more highs but it would be tricky to balance the clarity I was hearing versus increase high frequency energy. I wanted to see the effect of that crossover dip so dialed in an EQ for it:As with headphones, I could here a slight opening up of the sound and more forward/pleasant representation of female vocals I was listening to.  Overall effect though was small due to the bandwidth being low (1 kHz or so).  The eye was bleeding due to the graphs far more than the ear seemed to care!   I had to put in the dip at my usual 105 Hz to tame a room mode.  It was not necessary for the JBL 4349 but was in what to come: comparison to my Revel Salon 2 next to it.  Figured one of you rascals would ask me about it so I figured I do the work now!  Immediate reaction was wow, the Salon 2s have far deeper bass.  Visual impression of 4349's massive woofer (compared to Revel's) makes one think there is a ton of deep bass but there is not.  To match the Salon 2 would you need a sub.  That on the other hand meant that the 4349 didn't activate the room modes much so had a light, tight and dynamic bass. Beyond the bass the impression of the two speakers was so different. The salon 2 was producing a smooth, highly integrated sound column.  The 4349 seemed to have a dual character where it would be come extremely lively with high frequency dynamics.  This was super pleasurable but less refined than Salon 2's reserved but excellent reproduction.  My thought during the whole affair was that you really wanted both of these speakers and use them based on mood and music.This is one of few good sounding speakers that don't have the ""Revel sound"" to me.  It is a different way of solving the same problem.ConclusionsAs indicated above, objective test results left a sour taste in my mouth post measurements.  It was not until I listened to the speakers that I got what this speaker is all about:1. Marketing says you have to have a huge woofer and tweeter.  Don't care what else you do but it has too have this retro look.2. Engineering says so they want to compete with a party speaker.  Let's build the least broken, best version we can.So no, the 4349 is not objectively perfect.  That crossover dip pushes it out of the running compared to any modern studio monitor.  What it is, is re-implementing an old speaker configuration with the best know-how they could put in there.  An active version would have dealt with the deficiency there but the formula did not allow it.  Fortunately we can put EQ in front of the speaker and remedy that.A side note.  I hardly ever come home from a show thinking of replacing my speakers with anything I see there.  The only exception was a set of large horn speakers that had dynamics that I could not replicate with my Salon 2s.  The 4349 allowed me to get there and so points to high efficiency mattering.  People routinely underestimate how much power it takes to reproduce dynamics well.  Even my high power amplifier struggles to push the Salon 2 there.  But with 4349, that struggle disappeared with a bunch of headroom left.I am going to put the JBL 4349 on my recommended list.  Go ahead and hate on me due to objective measurements above.  I am ready to take it!  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150"

It is on kind loan from a member.  Note that this is the passive version, not active.  It has been discontinued and I can't find the original price in my search.  I see one on sale on ebay for US $120 plus $60 shipping.The sample I have has good bit of battle scars:There is good bit of heft to it and seemingly the walls are quite thick relative to thin walls we see today.Boy does the shape of the B2030 bring back fond memories of me buying my first studio monitor: a Genelec with the same vertical slot port (mine were active though).Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I used over 800 measurement point which was sufficient to compute the sound field of the speaker.  Temperature in measurement ""chamber"" was 71 degrees.  Location is at sea level.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: At first blush it seems that on-axis window has a lot of variations but if you take away the one resonance around 800 Hz, it is actually reasonably flat.  Interestingly, the off-axis as represented by early (and strongest) is very flat from 1 kHz up.  As a result, the Listening Window (dashed green) is also flatter than on-axis.We can zoom into early reflections and see this even better:Putting the two together we get a very nice predicted in-room response:Again, we have a couple of humps we have to deal with.  Also, given the near horizontal response, we are likely going to get a bright tonal response which needs some kind of ""target EQ curve"" to correct for hi-fi listening.  For a studio monitor, the flat response as designed may be appropriate though.Directivity control in the horizontal axis is very good, providing near constant response for much of audible spectrum:The beam width is also on the wider side making seating and toe-in less critical:Vertical response is typical (i.e. not as good as horizontal) so don't put the tweeter too far below or above the ear level:You want to avoid those two ""eyes"" (in blue) where the arrow is.Impedance is surprisingly high (and hence good) in bass:CSD/Waterfall plot clearly shows the resonance peak that we have around 800 Hz:To diagnose, I took nearfield measurements of the tweeter and woofer:We see the woofer breaking up farther past crossover point causing some up and downs there.  We also see the peak below the crossover and it seems to be a resonance of sorts in the woofer.  Other guesses are welcome.Distortion MeasurementsI am continuing to refine my distortion measurements hoping to standardize them soon.  Please don't post to say distortion is not audible, you don't believe it, etc.  This has been done 1000 times and doesn't need to be said again.Let's start with linearity test using 200 Hz frequency.  Yes, I should probably average a few frequencies but that is too much work.  We see better power capability than the Revel M106 with its smaller woofer which is good.Klippel measurements show our two distortion points:This woofer is definitely a distortion source.  Tweeter in contrast seems to be a calm amigo.Comparing to Revel M106 at 86 dB SPL we see the same problem:We can see it better as we increase the output to 106 dB SPL @1 meter:Not however that below 200 Hz the Behringer is actually better than the Revel.  Showing multiple levels at once we get this:Note that these are actual THD levels.  They are not ratios so let's look at that:We clearly see that distortion rises faster than output level in the woofer.  This is why you can't interpolate distortion from one level to another.  You have to measure it.Speaker Intermodulation Distortion MeasurementsLet's start by measuring 2nd and third-order (side band) intermodulation products of two tones in the woofer range:In the last speaker review I showed the absolute level rather than ratio.  I thought this method is better as it takes into account the output level differences between speakers.  I will be refining this more to bring better differentiation.  For now, looks like at this playback level, the Behringer B2030P is holding its own against the Revel M106.I worked on refining the 32-tone multitone test and I think the results are very presentable now:The -10 dB baseline shows that we can dig pretty low and not worry much about room noise now above 100 Hz or so.  As such, increasing the level (red) shows lots of intermodulation products.  At 3 kHz, we have about 80-35 = 45 dB of distortion-free range.Speaker Listening TestsYes, I saw the measurements before listening.  Shoot me!  Impression going in was that there is going to be some problems.  5 second impression did not agree with that.  Yes, the sound was bright but not in obnoxious way and otherwise, enjoyable.  I think even response above 1 kHz together with good directivity is something that is pleasing to my ears (and match my experience with Revel speakers).Of course, we can do better.  After some experimentation with equalization, I arrived these settings:Ignore Band 1 as that is to deal with a room mode that interferes with speaker listening tests.I put in the shelf in the form of Band 5 to get rid of brightness (to taste).  A proper filter would tilt down and not be a flat shelf like that.  But Roon can't generate that filter easily so I went with that.The speaker responded very well to Band 3 which pulled down that resonance.  Directivity is very good there so we are correcting the total response of the speaker (on and off axis).I then tried to pull down the smaller peak around 220 Hz.  That resulted in reduced bass performance which I did not like.  So I decided to fill in the dip before it.  We want more bass than highs anyway.  That worked well and seemingly reduced distortion and made the sound fuller as well.  A winner in my book.I tried my recent trick of putting a sharp filter in very low bass (around 30 Hz).  This time the trick did not work as it reduced bass which was less pleasant.  This speaker has a bass tuning that gives it more usable response that low.  Best to leave it alone.With these small tweaks the sound was wonderful!  I could happily listen to this speaker with EQ as my normal system.  Track after track in my reference library sounded great.  Female vocals, male vocals, instrumentals, classical, you name it, and it sounded good.What is more, the B2030P can play quite loud without bottoming out.  With a single speaker playing, I had no issue enjoying music at levels that I desired.ConclusionsThis old man of speaker has just a few flaws that are easily corrected with equalization.  Once there, it sounded quite good!  I would put ahead of many commercial budget speakers of today.  Sure, they may have copied Genelec but by doing so, gained what was good about that brand's design.It is a shame that we were not around years ago to add a vote of confidence to this speaker and keep its production going.  As it is, you have to hunt around for a used pair.If you have one and want to replace it, know that you have a high bar to cross.  This is no cheap junk speaker.I am happy to recommend the Behringer B2030P with equalization (without it, it will be too bright for many).-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Watched Youtube sushi video last night and got me really craving for some.

This speaker was purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  Alas, the customer can no longer afford them so if you are interested, let me know.  The retail cost US $5,000 each but discounts have become common with Revel speakers.NOTE: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman products including Revel.  While we don't do any retail business, I think it is fair for you to be on notice that there can be conflict of interest here.  Feel free to read as much bias as you like into my subjective remarks (objective measurements are made the same as any other speaker).This specific F228Be speaker is in gorgeous white color:Please excuse the speaker cable.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: On-axis response is as we expect from a Revel speaker: almost flat with just a dip visible around 7 to 9 kHz.  Early window response in dashed blue is almost the same as on-axis which indicates good directivity:Interesting that the large dips for floor and ceiling reflections actually help balance the overall response!  There is however a slight dip around 400 Hz.  That causes the only blemish in otherwise excellent predicted in-room frequency response:This should make the speaker very room friendly as reflections don't color the direct sound.Near-field measurements of each driver shows why the total response is so coherent:Horizontal beam width is flat until the upper treble range:Ditto for horizontal directivity:There is a bit of oddness though at 170 to 180 degrees.  That is come out from back of the case/tweeter.  Vertical directivity shows the needed freedom relative to tweeter axis and your ear height:Impedance dips low and with some phase angle so you better have a stout amplifier to drive the F228be:Some of the best news is in distortion department:Revel F228Be Listening Tests and EqualizationThis speaker was too heavy to drag upstairs to my normal listening room so testing was performed in our living room where I also tested the Revel F328Be.  First impression was NOT positive!  The sound was boomy and vocals lost in the midst of all that.  So I pulled out my room measurements and knocked down the two room modes around 89 Hz.  That made a remarkable difference.  The sound was now open, distortion-free and quite nice.  These large floor standers energize the room modes which can easily ruin the sound of even the best speakers.  I also added a slight boost in the 400 Hz (2 dB or so) which I thought balanced things out well (based on PIR response).  Sorry forgot to save the EQ snapshot on my laptop.  Can post if there is interest but really, other than the room mode, you don't need to do much.Once tuned to the room, the sound was sublime.  Track after track in my reference playlist filled the large space with incredible resolution and good bit of bass response.  One fantastic track was the Opera from Niklas Paschburg's album, Svalbard:You didn't want the music to end.  Comparisons to Revel F328Be SpeakerIt has been quite a while since I tested and listened to the Revel F328Be which I reviewed back in November of last year.  The F328 is a larger speaker and whether visually or audibly or both, projects a larger scale.  The F228Be at first made me think the sound was emanating from its tweeter and midrange but that effect quickly wore off.  With the F328Be, it lasted quite a bit longer as the tweeter height is higher.  I remember the bass being more substantial in F328Be but the F228Be has plenty of that as well.Objectively, the F328Be is a dB or two more efficient and has less distortion at 96 dBSPL:That's about half as much distortion in bass than the F228Be tested here.  The F328Be is a betters speaker but you need to sit farther from it so that the tweeter doesn't appear to be too high (until you get used to it).ConclusionsWhat can I say.  We expect Harman products as personified in Revel line to follow the best research we know in speakers to deliver and the F228Be does so.  Any more perfection would require active design and DSP to smooth things out even more.   Key here though is that these speakers deliver enough bass to activate room modes so you must have a strategy in place to deal with them.  If not, you are better off getting bookshelf speakers (even there EQ is important).  Without it, you ruin the sound of this speaker.It is my pleasure to put the Revel F228Be speaker on my recommended list.  I am happy it doesn't weight as much as my monster Salon 2 or the F328Be.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Such a pain in the butt to move around for demos and testing.  Full review can be found on my site here:https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/loudspeakers/jbl_hdi-3800/copy/paste below...JBL HDI-3800 Floorstanding Speaker ReviewTuesday, Mar 23, 2021Foreword / YouTube Video ReviewThe review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker. It is not intended to be a deep dive. Moreso, this is information for those who prefer “just the facts” and prefer to have the data without the filler.However, for those who want more - a detailed explanation of the objective performance, and my subjective evaluation (what I heard, what I liked, etc.) - please watch the below video where I go more in-depth.Information and PhotosNote: JBL was kind enough to loan me this item for test. I was not paid for my review and was not told what to say.The JBL HDI-3800 is 3-way Floorstanding speaker, standing approximately 45-inches tall with serious output capability. The below is from the manufacturer’s website:Designed and engineered in JBL’s world-famous acoustic engineering facility in Northridge, California, the HDI-3800 is the flagship of the JBL HDI Series. This floorstanding loudspeaker features a 2 ½-way design with patented High-Definition Imaging (HDI™) waveguide technology, the patented 2410H-2 1-inch (25mm) compression driver, and triple 8-inch (200mm) Advanced Aluminum Matrix cone woofers for powerful dynamics and incredibly accurate sound reproduction. The HDI-3800 enclosure is heavily braced to provide a solid acoustic foundation, and incorporates a bass reflex design with dual rear-firing, computer-optimized flared ports. The sophisticated curved cabinet features a modern design finished in a choice of automotive-grade painted High Gloss Black, or furniture-grade satin Walnut or Gray Oak wood veneers. A black cloth, magnetically attached grille completes the elegant appearance.Click to expand...MSRP per pair is approximately $5000 USD.And here are some specs, again from the manufacturer’s website:CTA-2034 (SPINORAMA) and Accompanying DataAll data collected using Klippel’s Near-Field Scanner. The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker’s high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field. For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:The reference plane in this test is at the tweeter. The speaker was tested in ported configuration (the port was not sealed). All testing in this review was done without grille.Measurements are provided in a format in accordance with the Standard Method of Measurement for In-Home Loudspeakers (ANSI/CTA-2034-A R-2020).

The speakers were placed approximately 1.2m from the front wall (not the cabinets; but the actual wall). The listening position was approximately 4 meters from the speakers.Below is the actual measured in-room response (with no DSP correction). This is a spatial average taken over approximately 1 cubic foot. As you can see, the actual in-room response aligns quite well with the prediction generated from the SPIN data. Pretty cool to see how anechoic measurements can reliably predict the actual in-room response. I feel many others often overlook this powerful benefit of the SPIN data.Black = Predicted In-Room Response from SPIN dataTeal = Actual In-Room Measured Response from Main Listening PositionThe prediction is quite accurate down to approximately 600Hz. Below this we see more deviation from the prediction. This is expected. The room takes over as you enter mid-to-low frequencies. Aside from the room dimensions, my couch, the back wall behind where I sit, the end table and the lamp near the listening position all influence the measured response. The dip from 150-400Hz is caused by the rear wall and/or couch as when the microphone is moved into the center of the room the dip fills in. Overall, what we see here is that the anechoic data can be conveniently used to predict the actual response one would expect to see in their own room.Parting / Random ThoughtsI encourage you to watch my YouTube review for more details but a quick few notes:At 45-inches tall and 83 pounds of pure awesomeness with triple 8-inch woofers these speakers command your attention.Overall tonality of these speakers was good but I wouldn’t put them on par with their Revel counterparts.There was something in the lower midrange (I ballparked it at about 200-300Hz) that I just didn’t like where lower female vocals tended to sound more boxy than I felt was right. At this point, I’m not entirely sure what the culprit is. When looking at the horizontal radiation pattern you can see the data shows approximately a ±100° radiation pattern at around 300Hz but then sharply drops to about 50-60° by 350-400Hz. This could be what I was hearing as problematic in this region. This coincides with a slight ripple in the impedance graphic around this frequency as well. Food for thought.Horn designs tend to be looked at with this nostalgic tendency to think they are “shouty” or “boxy”. Good waveguided-horn designs to not exhibit this characteristic. The JBL HDI-3800 possesses a great waveguide. There is no “shoutiness” that plague the designs of old (or current, lesser designs). If you are predisposed to having that bias against a waveguide design you can throw that out the window here.Panned music heavy in midrange content was placed at the upper midrange drive unit and resulted in a discontinuity in soundstage height between the midrange and the tweeter (main listening axis). This stood out to me when I listened to Joe Walsh’s “Rocky Mountain Way” as the guitar at the intro is panned left, right and center. When panned to either side, the soundstage height was “split” between upper and mid frequencies. The vertical contour plot shows an angular shift in intensity as you move from midrange to treble frequencies. This is exactly what I heard.Imaging and focus (the ability to place items within the soundstage and provide proper “size” to those items) was quite excellent. There was no ambiguity as to where placement of instruments / singers were throughout the soundstage which is a testament, in my opinion, to the nice off-axis response control of the waveguide.While the horizontal radiation is well controlled, the soundstage wasn’t as wide as I personally prefer. I attribute this to the radiation pattern of ±50° (above the bass region) whereas other speakers I have preferred in this regard were closer to ±60-70°.The HDI-3800s get downright loud. The best part was there were no mechanical limits being reached (i.e., port chuffing, speakers bottoming out). I had these playing at 105dB at 4 meters and they could have kept going if I had a larger amplifier (I used a Parasound Integrated 200 which is rated at 110 watts at 4/8 Ohms).The speakers are very low in distortion. Objectively and subjectively.The relatively-high sensitivity helps provide more “dynamics” as the amplifier has more “headroom” to play at louder levels while still having enough dynamic range to hit higher peaks with well-produced music.I really feel these speakers would benefit from a subwoofer below 40 or 50Hz.I believe the sweet spot for these speakers lies in the use of a mixture of music and movies. While they don’t have the fidelity, in my humble opinion, of some other speakers I have tested, they do have a mostly neutral response, plenty of output capability and do not require much power to get loud. I think this is a tradeoff for a speaker used in a setting where the listener will use them both for music listening and movie watching.As stated in the Foreword, this written review is purposely a cliff’s notes version.

800,23726449-dcf6-4cae-bf70-515777ef145c,Tower Speaker,Revel,Concerta2 F35,,4.9,Yes,3/14/20,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/revel-f35-speaker-review.12053/,0.0," Revel F35 floor-standing speaker.  I purchased this through my company because there are external anechoic measurements available so we can compare.  The F35 costs US $1,600 for a pair (sold each at US $800 in case you want a center speaker).  It comes in black and white but the black was not in stock so I purchased white:Fit and finish is superb.  You could easily pretend to your friends you paid multiples of its cost.  Disclaimer: Before I get into this review, and at the risk of stating the obvious, I have a million conflicts of interest here. I am a long time friend and professional colleague with a number of Harman employees (parent company of Revel). I have praised their design and research philosophy countless times. And our company, Madrona Digital is a Harman dealer (although we hardly sell any stereo gear). So read all the bias you want into the review but please don't go posting to complain. Just read the measurements if you are worried and if you don't trust that, just move along.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are reference to tweeter axis with the grill removed. Frequency resolution is 0.7 Hz (yes, less than 1 Hz) and plots are at 20 points/octave. Spatial 3-D resolution is 1 degree.Over 1000 points around the speaker were measured (from 20 to 20 kHz) which resulted in well under 1% error in identification of the sound field across full frequency response of 20 to 20 kHz with the exception of lowest frequencies.   I think this is due to multiple drivers creating a complex soundfield.  This is the first ""tower speaker"" I have measured on the Klippel system so we will need more data to know what we are dealing with.Final database of measurements and data is 1.2 Gigabytes in size.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: As you would expect in any Revel speaker, the on-axis speaker is quite flat although not perfectly so.  There are some glitches around and below 1 kHz that only showed up when I really pushed up the signal processing resolution.  They don't show up in Harman anechoic measurements, nor do they show the saddle at 20 to 40 Hz.  The latter I think is some kind of instrumentation error on my part per earlier explanation.  The SPL measurement is also speaker efficiency so we are talking about 90 dB which is above average in this day and age.Predicted in-room response is very good given the nice directivity (off-axis being generally similar to on-axis especially horizontally):I have added two key notes to the graph.  The second one will become important later.Impedance drops to near 3.5 Ohm so you need a beefy amplifier to drive this speaker:Distortion as a percentage of output when driven with 10 volt input looks like this:Putting aside the typical low frequency distortion, there is no other acoustic event of note.  Advanced Speaker MeasurementsEarly reflections which are the most audible in a typical room show that vertical reflections should be be absorbed or avoided:Horizontal reflections are clean which you should take advantage of by NOT absorbing side walls:Vertical reflections as noted above are not good:So put a thick carpet on the floor.  Frequency is high enough that 1 or 2 inch of absorption does the job.You have the option of not pointing the speaker directly at you (blue for example of 20 degrees out):Vertically based to stick with ear level which is there anyway given the height of the speaker:Very nice horizontal spread:Not so good vertically:Speaker Listening TestsBeing simply the taller version of Revel M16 which I recently reviewed, I expected immediate gratification.  Imagine my surprise when that did NOT happen!  Detail was muddy and sound was not enjoyable reminding me of my test of KEF R3 which I just reviewed.  How could this be?We make fun of subjectivists often but hey, maybe we should listen to them sometimes.  So I setup the speaker to play pink noise for 24 hours.  Then I played my favorite tracks again.  Wow.  I could not believe my ears.  All the micro-detail and detail materialized.  Incredible!!!Well, it would be incredible if the above was true but none of that is real.  Where do you think we are?  We don't believe in fantasties.To borrow a line from the movie Martian, I decided to science the sh*t out of it.  First I went back to KEF R3 to confirm that it had the same issue and it did.  Two different speakers and the same problem?  Both the R3 and F35 have more bass than M16 so how about a high pass filter?  Dial one in quickly in Roon with a 6 dB decline starting at 100 Hz.  Amazing.  Some of the issues with R3 went away.  Still not as good as the M16 but detail became better and sound fluidity improved.Past experience with equalizing the room in low frequencies had taught me that removing bass resonances not only improves bass, but has a remarkable (good) effect on notes above that range.  Resonances boost certain bass frequencies.  In time domain that lengthens the amount of time it takes for those high energy notes to go away.  And that steps on much lower level notes in higher frequencies.So let's measure the room and see what we are working with (with KEF R3 on stand):I have filtered this with 1/6 octave so there is not much clutter.  Focusing below 200 Hz, we see our loudest and most offending peak is around 100 Hz.  Let's dial in a single parametric filter by eye and see what does:Beauty of Roon is that its filters can be switched on and off in a second.  Boy, was that a miracle fix!  Gorgeous detail was there with almost no loss in total bass energy.  Indeed bass was now tighter.  The ""magic"" that I heard in the Revel M16 was now imparted into KEF R3.  Playing with gain showed that there is a happy range for it.  Too much attenuation did what you think intuitively: you lost bass.  Too little and the magic would start to disappear.  Swapped out the R3 with Revel F35 and after a bit of gain adjustment, sweet sound was flowing like nobody's business! My location for speaker testing is in one corner of my room.  That is emphasizing bass modes.  When Harman tests speakers, they place them in the center of the room and likely have worked to optimize the listening distance to reduce room modes.  As it is, speakers with more bass get penalized.  With my Revel Salon 2 tested the same way, the peak at 102 Hz was even higher requiring more gain reduction.Note that the above is not an everyday issue as I use Dirac for room EQ for my system when it is normally being used.  I had decided to test speakers without EQ and that came to bite me given the circumstances.With this issue out of the way, I leaned on the Revel F35 to see how much clean power it can produce.  Wow, this thing can take it and dish out.  I could not believe the powerful bass and loudness I was getting out of a single speaker.  There was no strain whatsoever making these speakers great for home theater as well as music listening.  ConclusionsWhile in the ""budget"" portion of Revel line, and too low priced to be considered as ""high-end"" by the audio industry, the Revel F35 objectively and subjectively produces stellar performance.  A bit of low frequency EQ is all it took for it to sound good without any fiddling with location, toe-in, room treatment, etc, etc.  I am happy to recommend the Revel F35. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Have to drive out 130 miles tomorrow to pick up another speaker for review.

I bought this recently for $149 from Amazon. As you can imagine, a floor standing speaker at this price has to be quite light and this one definitely is.  I can easily lift it as it weighs less than many bookshelf speakers.  What a marvel of cost optimization:Yes, my system area is dusty.  Do you want more reviews or clean listening room???This is a 2-way speaker with two passive radiators to improve bass response.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

Grill was not used.Polk T50 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:I expected the response to be horrific but it is not that bad.  Yes we have a peak around 1 kHz and then shelving up of the highs which is a requirement for ""showroom selling"" against its competitors which boost the heck out of that region.Hard to see the sources of the uneven response from near-field measurement:I guessed that the peaking at 1 kHz may be due to passive radiators resonating.  The math is too complex to visually confirm though.Early window frequency response shows vertical directivity messing with overall sum:As noted -- and it is how I have my room -- use a thick carpet.  That should be a nice absorber from 1 kHz up which we need to fix that trough and extra high frequency energy.  High ceilings help to reduce the impact of bounce in that direction.  Or you can stick an ugly absorber up there.Predicted in-room response is not super smooth:The effect of elevated treble is obvious. But that peak at 1 kHz followed by slight dip, not so much.Edit: forgot to include distortion graphs:Horizontal beam width is again, not too bad if we don't try to be too critical:Vertical directivity gets worse if you sit below tweeter so tilt the speaker forward if that is the case:Impedance is the typical 4 ohm or so:Tons of resonances are visible likely due to think cabinet and who knows what else.Polk T50 Listening Tests and EqualizationI must say, first impression was not bad at all.  Unlike just about any bookshelf speaker, the T50 is able to handle tons of power and gets quite loud and dynamic with little evidence of stress.  Throwing difficult sub-bass material at it didn't impact it since it simply doesn't try to play them (its bass response has a sharp cut off).  Yes, there is a bit of brightness but judging that is often problematic as you don't know the content's spectrum and lack a frame of reference.Best way to determine audibility of frequency response is to try to straighten it and see if you like it better.  That is precisely what I do with EQ:Ignore the first dip as that is for my room.  Without it, there is enough bass activation to make the sound a bit boomy.  The rest of the filters thankfully are mostly reduction which help with distortion as well.  With all of them in place, the difference was not night and day but enough to make the T50 very enjoyable to listen to.  Call me surprised!ConclusionsGoing into this review I expected the T50 to be junk.  It did not turn out that way.  It is a miracle of engineering and manufacturing to get a floor standing speaker in my hands for just $149 and have it not be broken.  Objectively there are some issues but somehow subjectively, it seems less flawed.  With a bit of EQ, it improves even more to a proper ""hi-fi"" class.  Despite cheap bookshelves, the T50 is able to produce lots of volume and dynamics which I really value and enjoy.I am going to recommend the Polk T50 especially with equalization.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me for measurements.  Revel F208 costs $2,500 each or US $5,000 for a pair.Note: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Revel speakers.  Feel free to read as much bias as you like in this review.  The unit as tested is in piano black which gives a luxurious feel to the unit.  Alas, the unit was too heavy for me to lug it up to my listening room so you have to settle for a plastic wrapped version of it in my test ""lab:""There was a sturdy sheet of plastic covering the front which I took off but left the rest of the plastic on it to protect it as you see in this shot:I went through a bit of hell trying to figure out why the speaker would not plays the highs at first.  After hours of trying to figure it out, and losing out a day, I realized it was a simple thing: the bar wires I was using would not always allow the shorting bar to do its job.  I have to use a bare wire as to lower the interference around the speaker as the robotic arm moves the mic around.  Anyway, I have to take the speaker to the owner in an hour so no time for listening tests either.This speaker was the heaviest I have tested and despite having that wonderful lift you see in the first picture, it was a killer to unpack and move around.I played with the bass compensation and it does what it says: if you set it to boundary, it lowers the bass level.  I did not test the tweeter one but I suspect it does the same.  An array of power resistors behind that panel makes these simple level changes.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS).

In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are referenced to the tweeter axis with frequency resolution of 2.7 Hz.

This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:Edit: these are updated measurements based on optimization of the numerical analysis in the bass response.There is good correlation with Harman measurements:I was puzzled that the on-axis response was not as smooth as I expect Revel speakers to have.  That disappeared when I looked at the rest of the measurements starting with predicted in-room response:Wow!  With no DSP this speaker managed to get such balanced and smooth response.  It appears that the off-axis response is tuned to counter the on-axis response as we see here:This makes the speaker fairly room independent and sharply increases your chances of putting this in any room and enjoying accurate sound reproduction.Distortion levels are very much controlled:Ignore the rise in very low frequencies as that goes beyond the speaker's ability to reproduce.  The rest shows no ""acoustic events"" other than a bit of wiggliness between 100 and 200 Hz:In this calibrated graph where the range is 50 dB, I like to see nothing but blank space for distortion and the F208 gets there with the exception of the lower frequency range.Impedance test shows dipping to 3.5 ohm so you better have a high current amplifier that doesn't mind such loads:Horizontal directivity diagram shows very wide response which means you don't have to sit in a vice to get good sound:And if you left the side wall reflections bare, you should get wider image.  The inclusion of that mid-range gives good dispersion to whopping 100 degrees!Vertically the situation is not as good as we typically see in non-coaxial designs:I am in a hurry so could not optimize the CSD plot so here it is:I wanted to see if I could diagnose the up and downs in high frequencies so ran this 3-d plot:The problem could also be the mid-range still going as we see in the hot area below the tweeter.Speaking of that, I had time to run the lower bit by itself:But am out of time to calibrate the tweeter response and overlay it.ConclusionsI expected textbook on-axis response but did not quite get that out of Revel F208.  But the speaker came to its own with stellar predicted in-room response which is what ultimately matters as you hear both direct and indirect sounds.  Off-axis summed response also looks superb.  People ask me if they should buy Revel speakers.  I always tell them they should for two reasons:1. You can put them in just about any room and they sound great due to off-axis response being carefully designed.2. They are the only speakers designed and released with double-blind listening tests.I wish I had done my listening tests so I could make my own judgement with F208 but I don't have time as I have to pack and drive them to the owner in a few minutes.  But based on measurements, I think they come very close to my Revel Salon 2.  If so, they should sound wonderful.I am going to put Revel F208 speaker on my recommended list.  I know, shocker.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Killed my back moving this speaker around so had to hire someone to get rid of all the weeds as @Thomas savage is not available.

It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  They cost US $3,800 a pair.This sample came in ""piano block"" which I must say, really dresses up this speaker:The horn looks a bit plasticy (sp?) but barely so.  Between the white washed oak and this color, I take this.This is a heavy speaker and had I not bought a lift to get it nearly 6 foot high to measure, I would be hurt already!  For listening tests though, I put it my shoulder and carried it two floors up to my listening room, wondering what sin I committed to be doing this in later stages of my life...Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.All measurements are referenced to the tweeter axis with frequency resolution of 2.7 Hz.   I used a high number of scans (over 1000 measurements) which was a good thing as the soundfield this speaker generates is rather complex.  In the process I made a breakthrough in low frequency measurements.  See below.Spinorama Audio MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker can be used. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:When I first ran this test, the low frequency level had a distinct dip and the shelving on the far left was far deeper.  Examining the sound field, I realized with two ports in the back and two drivers in the front plus resonances from the cabinet, there is a lot of complexity.  Normally it is assumed that the wavelength of low frequency is high enough that this type of mixing doesn't matter.  But it does.  I compensated in the numerical analysis and dialed out most of it.  The shelving on the far left could not be fixed with software fix, requiring measurements at longer distance.  I don't have much more room on that front but I will experiment with future speakers.  For now, I doubt that much useful output exists at 30 Hz.And yes, this applies to previous speakers I have measured with good bit of bass, especially if they show the shelving.  As I get time, I will go back and regenerate the spin data for them.Anyway, on to our measurements, we have a pretty flat response.  The only issue is a small regression from HDI-3100 in that the off-axis around the crossover point is less seamless in 3600.  And we have two of them rather than one since this is a 3-way speaker.Efficiency is higher as advertised to tune of 90 dB.Early reflections graph shows much wider variation when we look at different directions than the HDI-1600 which had these tightly grouped:Noticed the wide shelving down above 2 kHz.  This impacts our simulated room response some:Vertical dispersion is more of an issue here than horizontal as we see in this comparison:It is typical to get such dips but the one in HDI-3600 is wider, allowing more notes to hit and hence be more audible.  Then again its upper bass is more flat than 1600.There are dual bindings on the back so you can split the speaker into two.  The bottom connector drivers the woofer and mid-range and the upper, tweeter:I applied partial compensation for the room below 700 Hz (can't apply full correction or it will attempt to flat the response to 20 kHz) to the woofer.  This causes the bit of wiggliness between 700 and 1 kHz so ignore that.Nice to see both the mid-range and tweeter being so clean in the crossover region.  Neither seems stressed beyond their crossover point.Distortion seems very well under control:I have set a tentative target of 0.5% for myself and the HDI-3600 gets there in mid-frequencies where our hearing is most sensitive.Impedance is a bit above 4 ohm which is a relief:Horizontal directivity is good but not super wide:Vertical though shows and amplifies the issues we have seen above:If you look to the left of the point of the arrow, you see that the highest amplitude points down which is due to the mid-range and then woofer taking over.  In other words, the acoustic center is fairly frequency dependent.  Vertical alignment of the speaker relative to your ears will be important.Finally the waterfall:Speaker Listening TestsI was ready to be impressed the moment I powered on the HDI-3600, and I was not!  It didn't sound bad but didn't great either.  I went through a bunch of tracks and same was true.  With my back bothering me after lifting this thing two floors, I gave up and reclined back in my chair, only to have the fidelity improve substantially!  It was then that I realized with my tall stand the HDI-1600 was placed higher than where the tweeter of the HDI-3600 was.  The ideal position for the 3600 was with the ear level below the tweeter, close to mid-between tweeter and mid-range below it.Close examination shows large variation as you move up and down close to the tweeter axis.  This is why you saw the emphasis in those measurements in my review here.  At standard height you have to put something under the HDI-3600 to elevated it to the right level if your seating is as low as mine.  Alternatively, you can sit farther where this doesn't matter as much.  Indeed as soon as I walked away, the sound become much nicer.Bass performance and ability to get loud is impressive.  I turned it up as high as I could tolerate and I could barely detect any distortion.  Mind you, it won't go super deep but what is there is clean and super dynamic.  Despite playing only one speaker, I had no trouble getting the entire floor and my back to resonate!  These speakers will be great for home theater, able to keep up with the dynamic range of a subwoofer.ConclusionsThere seems to be a bit of a trade-off between HDI-1600 and HDI-3600.  Addition of a mid-range and more bass drivers allows sensitivity to go up substantially.  On the other hand, the crossover points are not as optimal.  Vertically there is a narrow sweet spot if you sit with 2 to 3 height of the speaker.  So be sure to experiment with that and tilt the speaker up a bit if you need.I am going to put the JBL HDI-3600 on my recommended list.  Can't give it the highest honors due to pickiness regarding vertical placement and slight regression in off-axis directivity around the crossover point.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I think it is prudent that I start to save money for a hernia operation at this rate.

I purchased this months ago with one of those crazy sales prices JBL often has.  Right now is one such occasion with the cost dropping to US $160 from list price of $400.Considering what you get, the retail cost is hard to believe:Dual woofers, mid-range, and tweeter in a nicely finished box for just $200?

Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.The system performed over 1000 measurements which resulted in error rate of more or less 1%.Temperature was 61 degrees F.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis is the center of the tweeter.  I also tried it at mid-point between midrange and tweeter but it made no difference.EDIT: something had gone wrong physically with my measurement mic in the original review.  The cap on it had come loose and then proceeded to rotate 45 degrees, hanging by a thread!  It was not that way when I started the measurements but somehow ended there.  That changed the high frequency resonances of the mic, resulting in peaking that we had.  I have remeasured the speaker and edited the data in this review now.Infinity 253 MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws:The on-axis response is pretty good from 100 Hz to about 1.5 kHz.  Then it becomes a bit messy followed by shelving up starting at 4 kHz.  Deviation is not huge but likely going to make the speaker sound bright without the delicious detail I like to hear around 1 to 2 kHz.Directivity (how similar on and off axis response are) is good so equalization should work.Because directivity is good, early window reflections show same issues:Putting the two together tells us what we already know about predicted in-room frequency response:We like to have more of a tilt than what we have here as otherwise the speaker will sound bright.  Reduction of bass energy between 50 and 100 Hz will accentuate this brightness.Here is the near-field response:The tweeter level is higher but doesn't peak the same away.  Perhaps that bowtie guard keeps it from doing this when measured in near field?Distortion levels were disappointing as well:Inclusion of midrange provides good directivity:Other than that dip around 2 kHz, that is excellent response.Here is our vertical response:You have much more degrees of freedom as compared to 2-way bookshelves.  Still, best to stay at or below tweeter axis as otherwise you get more of that 2 kHz dip.Impedance graph shows a couple of resonances although I don't see a sign of the first one in the spin:Infinity R253 Speaker Listening TestsIn the original review, I failed to get rid of the brightness in this speaker despite using my measurements as a rule.  The new measurements show why I went wrong as we just need a broad shelving filter to get rid of the brightness:I then boosted up the mids around 2 kHz and that provided a bit more detail in that critical region.I really liked the sound so I started to click to my playlist only to be greeted with my Mark Levinson No 53 shutting down again.    Powered back on and bam, it happened again.  Switched in an old Infinity bookshelf speaker.  No problem whatsoever.  Put the R253 in, turn up the volume and shut down again.  Switch to my Revel Salon 2 speakers.  No problem with even ear bleeding levels.  Something in this speaker is causing the protection in my amplifier to turn on.  Having tested nearly 100 speakers with the same amplifier, it definitely is not due to the amp being overly sensitive.EDIT: Well, it turned out (later) that one of my Mark Levinson amps driving this speaker was indeed failing (gradually).  It proceeded to get worse so this should NOT impact this speaker's performance and review.If it had stayed running, I would have likely added in some bass to level the 40 to 100 Hz as that worked well before.ConclusionsThe Infinity Reference 253 is one hell of a package.  You couldn't build one quarter of it for what they are selling it for right now.  The new measurements show excellent performance, sans two bits: a dip around 2 kHz and too much treble energy.  Both were easily fixable with EQ.  Alas, I could not listen for long due to it not getting along with my amplifier.  How much this issue translates to others using the speaker, I don't know.The faults above keep me from recommending the Infinity R253 even though it can be a killer speaker if you use EQ and it doesn't shut down on you.  You have the data to decide for yourself.EDIT: with the fault now identified to be the amp, I am going to move to giving a recommendation to Infinity RS253.New spin data is enclosed.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
8000,20181712-2cf2-42c7-a73e-4ac259be4d75,Tower Speaker,Revel,PerformaBe F328Be,91.0,6.5,Yes,11/10/20,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/revel-f328be-speaker-review.17443/#post-564847,3.0," Revel F328Be floor standing speaker.  I purchased a single unit through our company (Madrona) with kind discount from Harman Sales (I asked for a review sample from the PR group but was told ""don't call us, we will call you."").  The retail cost of F328Be is US $8000 each or $16,000 for a pair.  This makes it the most expensive speaker we have tested to date.I chose the color black and I must say, this is one gorgeous speaker:It comes in an exquisite finish with sparkles in it in the top panel:Even the Beryllium tweeter exudes beautify (in the eye of an audiophile of course):Here is a closer shot of the speaker itself:As you see, there are three 8 inch woofers backed by two large ports in the back.  There is then a mid-range and tweeter.Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter). It also measures the speaker at close distance (""near-field"") which sharply reduces the impact of room noise. Both of these factors enable testing in ordinary rooms yet results that can be more accurate than an anechoic chamber. In a nutshell, the measurements show the actual sound coming out of the speaker independent of the room.I performed over 2000 measurement which resulted in error rate of less than 1% throughout the range.  This took over 4 hours to capture all the data which resulted in a 1.5 gigabyte file (imagine doing this work manually!).Temperature was 60 degrees F. Measurement location is at sea level so you compute the pressure.Measurements are compliant with latest speaker research into what can predict the speaker preference and is standardized in CEA/CTA-2034 ANSI specifications. Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Reference axis was between the midrange and tweeter (a guess).Revel F328Be MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: This speaker was very difficult to measure in low frequencies.  The combination of two ports and three woofers created an overly complex low frequency sound field. The initial runs produced clearly incorrect measurements below 200 Hz.  After five sets of measurements and optimization, I dialed out almost all the error.  The results show that little step between 100 and 200 Hz which Harman data does not.  I suspect with a bit more optimization that could have been filled in a bit more.  This aside, for a passive speaker we have excellent flatness of response especially considering how many sound producing elements there are here.Efficiency is superb for a Revel speaker but do keep in mind that we need power in low frequencies the most and there, we don't have nearly the 91 dB that we have in the upper range.  This of course applies to all speakers.Look at how the dashed blue line (early window) nicely parallels the black dashed green line indicating excellent directivity (direct and indirect sounds match). This makes the speaker room friendly as the reflections don't change the tonality of the speaker much.  And also allows easy equalization.  Let's look at the sum of important early reflections:Amazing that all the varying reflections sum to such a smooth response.  Putting everything together, we get a prefect predicted in-room frequency response:It took me forever to measure all the drivers and ports in near-field.  Turns out most of them were duplicating each other's response so here is a sample set:Notice the port tuning down to 30 Hz!  This speaker should produce very deep bass.  And clean too when you look at these incredible distortion measurements:Are you seeing what I am seeing?  Even at 96 dB SPL, you hardly have any bass distortion.  Indeed during measurements, I could hear the most perfect sweep ever of any speaker I have tested.  Most of the time I hear the pitch change/distort during the range.  Not here.  The sweep was so buttery smooth.  Yes, that is an objective technical term!Here is the distortion in absolute level:I picked 50 dB as a rather arbitrary limit long time ago with speaker after speaker missing that mark in low frequencies.  Not the Revel F328Be.  With the exception of one frequency, it stays well below that.Horizontal beam width is very smooth:Notice how the line in pink is also smooth (-12 dB).Shown as a contour map, we see the same nice response:Due to inclusion of a mid-range, the vertical response is also good compared to our typical 2-way speakers:Since this is a tall speaker, you may want to tilt it down a bit if you are sitting too close to it.Finally, here is our impedance measurement:That is a pretty low impedance so make sure you have a good, high-current amplifier to go with this speaker.There is a small resonance visible but I don't see a sign of it in the frequency response so it must be quite minor.Revel F328Be Listening TestsTruth to be told, I measured this speaker weeks back.  But then it sat in the garage because I could not figure out how to carry it to our loft to listen to it.  I almost post just the measurements but then I thought questions of sound and comparison against my Revel Salon 2 would come from every angle.  Asked my wife if should could help me drag it upstairs and she said no way as did my back.  Didn't know what to do for a while until I realized there was another option: create a setup in our living room which is at the same level as the garage.  So I built a quick system out of Matrix Element i streamer and DAC plus Purifi Amplifier.  The picture you saw at the start of the review was the setup except I had the speaker further into the room.First impression was: ""this is the sound I am always looking in a speaker.""  It sounded very familiar to me as it should.  What surprised me though was the deep bass.  I had not heard such clean and deep bass out of any speaker I have tested so far.  My own Salon 2 speakers produce them of course but nothing I had tested would come close.  The F328Be was there.  It is a wonderful kind of bass you don't get out of a sub in how clean and integrated it is.  It doesn't jump out to slap you in the face.  At the same you wonder why you had never heard these notes with smaller speakers.I ran through my ""speaker killer"" tracks which are full of these sub bass frequencies and the F328Be produced them like it was an everyday affair.  Even at super elevated levels, the sound was exceptionally clean.  No hint of bass distortion let alone bottoming out.  I could see the triple woofers moving but no deep excursion to make them distort.The one sensation you should know about is that these are tall speakers.  When placed too close to you, the voices sound like they are way above you.  In a way this is a natural presentation of the size of a singer.  But at the same time, you don't want it to keep reminding you so.  Push them out and this effect reduces.I actually listened to the F328Be out in the open first before pushing it into the corner.  The latter did cause a bit of boominess due to room mode.  I don't have current measurements for our living room so I did not try to dial them out.  It is the nature of speakers that play low that they excite room modes more, requiring DSP correction for best sound.So do the F328Be speakers outperform my Salon 2?  With no ability to listen to them in the same spot, I can't say for sure.  I can say that at no time I wished I had the F328Be instead of my Salon 2.  Its sound simply asymptote up the level of Salon 2 but didn't exceed it.  You are spending $6,000 less with 328Be so coming this close is impressive.In some sense I am the wrong guy to review this speaker, coming from Salon 2.  It was impossible to impress me with a speaker with similar tonality and performance.  ConclusionsIt was great to test the premier speaker in Harman's newest line.  The F328Be is in entirely different class than any other speaker we have tested.  The difference comes in impressive bass performance that is essentially distortion-free.  This brings a level of clarity and dynamics that is addictive.  You can play as loud as you possibly want and the speaker comes along happily.  No sign of any change in speaker response.  It is just at home playing audiophile tracks and rock and roll.Needless to say, I am happy to recommend the Revel F328Be.  If you want to buy a set of speakers and be done with it, you know what to get now!------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.This was our 100th speaker review and measurements!!! Hooray!Hard to imagine testing so many speakers since January.  When I bought the Klippel NFS measurement system, I was wondering how it would ever pay for itself.  I figured if I tested 100 speakers, it would still cost $1000 per so we could have just asked a service to do the work.  But here we are in less than a year and we are already passing that benchmark.  Here is to another 100 speaker reviews!Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
499,59225e1c-67c9-414d-934a-db3ad0ae337e,Tower Speaker,Focal,Chora 816,91.0,3.8,Yes,3/15/23,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/focal-chora-816-speaker-review.42988/,0.0,"This is a review, listening tests and detailed measurements of Focal Chora 816 floor-standing/tower speaker. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $499.Despite the low price, the speaker is beautifully finished with a curved port and beautiful light oak finish:A magnetic grill covers the dual woofers but leaves the port and tweeter alone as there is nothing to damage there.Speaker is made in France which again, is surprising given the low cost.The design is 2.5 way, seemingly aimed at home theater applications.  Past 2.5-way designs we have reviewed have had issues so let's see if they persist here as well.Note: by experimentation, I arrived at the reference axis at the upper rim of the mid-woofer below tweeter. Focal Chora 816 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual anechoic frequency response measurements:At ""macro"" level the response is good with more or less flat on-axis.  There are however small chewiness especially in midfrequencies.  And somewhat elevated treble.  Sensitivity is high at 91+ which is a benefit of large enclosure of a tower speaker. Bass extension is down to 45 Hz or so (F6).  Measuring each driver at point blank gives us more insight at the reasons for above:With cabinet/port and lower frequency woofer resonating, we get fair bit of variations in mid frequencies as noted.  Nicely though, the mid-woofer (blue) resonances are at higher frequencies and lower amplitude so not as destructive.Early window reflections average out to smoother response but with a pronounced peak around 8 kHz.  Given how broad it is, it will be pretty audible:It shows up clearly in predicted in-room response:So we are going to have some brightness but otherwise, response is pretty smooth.Benefit of the 2.5 way design comes from two woofers holding hands to produce much more power relative to distortion they produce as each working in more linear region:Horizontal beamwidth is fairly controlled which was a pleasant surprise:From memory, I thought it narrowed sooner than typical 2-way designs:Vertically there is good bit of narrowing so best to position your ear at the upper rim of the mid-woofer:Impedance curve is complex due to the design but has a typical 4 ohm low point:Waterfall display shows fair bit of resonances:And here is the step response for fans of that:Focal Chora 816 Speaker Listening TestsUpon power up, I immediately noticed the extra sharpness.  Mind you, it was pleasant in the way it brought out so much detail but still, it was too much.  Per measurements, I dialed in a single filter for that:The sound was still a bit bright but I wanted to keep that character there so did not play with it more.  On bass heavy material, the response from speaker went down low enough to activate the room mode I have at 105 Hz so I quickly dialed in a dip for that (not a fault of the speaker).  That tightened the bass and now the sound was very enjoyable.  What really impressed me was the incredible dynamics and power handling of this speaker.  Powered by my 800 watt amplifier, it played effortlessly with impressive, gut feeling bass.  Sub-bass response (below 30 Hz) was there and only slightly distorted.  Certainly far, far above any 2-way speaker I have tested in this regard.  And probably the best sound I have heard out of a tower speaker at this price point!I sat there in amazement and enjoyed track after track.  Yes, small filters for the various resonances in mid frequencies would likely make things better yet.  But I was satisfied enough to not want to mess with them.ConclusionsThe positive look and feel of Chora 816 put me in good mood for testing of the speaker.  On the other hand, once I saw the 2.5-way designation, I thought we were going to have problems. It seems that Focal has managed to keep most of the negatives of this approach to acceptable levels while bringing its high output capability to the table. The tweeter plays a bit bright.  I imagine this is by design to give it some ""showroom sound.""  In that regard, it is much more tasteful than others in its price class.  A single filter was enough to deal with that.  Alternatively you could toe out the speaker to accomplish something similar (I always listen on-axis).Story becomes very convincing when one considers the low price and manufacturing in France!  Clearly Focal knows what they are doing in their vertical integration to bring such a solution to market.The Focal Chora 816 is an easy recommendation for me given its amazing power handling, great looks and very good performance at low price.  It is now my favorite in this price range (and even higher).-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly loaned to me by a local member and costs US $2,400 (pair).The overall fit and finish is nice:The tweeter though looks odd and takes away from the clean look as does that sticker between woofer and port.  The Antal EZ was quite heavy requiring my son's assitance to lift it on top of the measurement rig and then two flight of stairs to listen to (picture above).Measurements that you are about to see were performed using the Klippel Near-field Scanner (NFS). This is a robotic measurement system that analyzes the speaker all around and is able (using advanced mathematics and dual scan) to subtract room reflections (so where I measure it doesn't matter).

Likewise listening tests are performed per research that shows mono listening is much more revealing of differences between speakers than stereo or multichannel.Triangle Esprit Antal Ez MeasurementsAcoustic measurements can be grouped in a way that can be perceptually analyzed to determine how good a speaker is and how it can be used in a room. This so called spinorama shows us just about everything we need to know about the speaker with respect to tonality and some flaws: The most glaring issues are rather rough bass response all the way up to 600 Hz.  Post that we also have a number of resonances but overall response is more of less flat on axis which is good.  The roughness in the low frequencies was rather odd and unusual.  I *think* I have identified that peak around 260 Hz is coming from the mid-range driver.  See these near-field measurements:Same resonance shows in both tweeter and midrange but is much stronger in the latter.  Now, that could be low frequency response that gets picked up by the mic in this position.  Let's look at the two woofers then:Notice that the woofer closest to the mid-range shows more of a problem than the one that is farthest (right).  All of seems to point to the midrange as the source.  But then when we look at the port, we see it strongly there as well:I am thinking that may still be mid-range bleeding back through the box and coming out the port.   What do you all think?Back to our ""spin data,"" our early reflections are more or less similar to direct axis with some high frequency roll off:Summing the two spins, we get this predicted in-room frequency response:Seems like our problem area is from 150 Hz to aforementioned 600 Hz or so.Impedance was the lowest I have measured at just 2.7 ohm:You need a proper amp that doesn't mind pumping out current.  We also see multiple resonances which we had seen in the frequency response measurements as well.Distortion goes up around a few of these resonances:The amount of distortion is unacceptably high for a floor standard at 96 dBSPL.  We are used to seeing bass distortion but here, but not well above that in such distinct patterns which should have been investigated.  The first mountain centered around 250 Hz coincides with our resonance so definitely a cause and effect there.Beam width shows narrowing of the response horizontally with frequency which is not all that bad by itself:I expected better directivity vertically given the inclusion of a midrange:Hard to sit at a level higher than the tweeter so you may need to pointing down to not fall in that hole around 3 to 4 kHz.Speaker Listening TestsThe first impression was ""this is not bad.""  Power handling was excellent and I could play very loud with any deep bass break up.  Then again, there was not much deep bass.I brought up the measurements and tried experimenting with equalizations.   This is very tricky as the response anomalies are in low frequencies where the room heavily modifies the response of the speaker.  So what we see in anechoic measurements above may not be what I was experiencing in my room.  First attempt at filling the holes around the 260 Hz resonance was a failure.  I scrapped that and just pulled down the resonance and that worked well:I lost a bit of bass response but I thought clarity improved. I tried to compensate again with boosting some of the other areas around it but it just resulted in boominess so I gave up.  You would need to make in-room measurements to do better than I did.As a way of comparison, I put my Revel M16 next to the Triangle on a stand.  While tonality and to some extent clarity was better on the Revel, the sound was clearly localized to a smaller source vertically, leaving a preference for the Triangle for the larger, more realistic image it portrayed. I replaced the Revel with Infinity R253.  The R253 was not a match at all for the Triangle.  It sounded puny and weak.  Humbled, I took out the big guns and connected the Revel Salon 2 next to the Triangle.    OK, now were talking sublime sound quality!     Wow, sometimes I forget how wonderful the Salon 2 sounds.  I spend so much time testing other speakers I don't get much time with them.  The Salon 2 naturally had much deeper bass but it was also so clean and tonally smooth that you just couldn't go back to the Triangle.  10X the price and better engineering was of course at play there.ConclusionsWe have a speaker here with some good qualities but also a glaring issue in bass response.  It is as if they took an existing design and yanked out a woofer or something and left the rest sort of unfinished.  The problems would easily show up in even DIY measurements let alone the (small) anechoic chamber that Triangle shows in their marketing material.  It is a shame they did not go after them to fix it as it could have made for a nice speaker.As is, I can't recommend the Triangle Esprit Antal Ez.  Per my listening tests though, with EQ, it can provide an enjoyable experience though so if you own it, it is serviceable.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
