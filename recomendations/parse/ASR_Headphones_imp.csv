I purchased this back in 2017 mainly to test headphone amplifiers.  The latest version which I am told is different costs US $185 from Amazon including Prime shipping.The HE400i is quite light and fits quite well on my head:The stock cord is removable which is nice.  As is though, it is stiff, rather short and comes with that odd right angle 3.5mm headphone jack.  Seems like they assumed people would be using this in a portable application.  For my desktop use all of these are aggravations.  I have to use a 1/4 inch adapter with it and the right angle cord gets in the way of my controls.  The short cord has also pulled the headphone off my head in more than one occasion.Here is a zoomed picture of the cup with no informational value:The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.I have calibrated my headphone fixture with 94 dBSPL test tones and decided that I use the same for headphone measurements. However, instead of using 1 kHz tone I have opted for 425 Hz. This seems to better match research data.I have also made a lot of progress in building a better test suite for the measurements. More updates and changes will be coming but I am starting to feel good about this set.Hifiman HE400i (2016) MeasurementsThere is nothing more important than frequency response of the headphone as each is seemingly different and that difference leaves a very distinct character: The ASR preference curve is in sold dashed blue.  The red and green are each channel.  Matching is pretty good.  What is not good is cheating us out of a lot of energy in the all important region of 1 to 3 kHz.  Why oh why?  This is a common theme among many headphones it seems.  As is usual, bass energy is lower than our target although not as bad as some others I have tested.What is unusual is all the kinks and noise in the graph.  Transfer function of the headphone must be changing in complex ways to create these.  Indeed looking at the distortion curve shows us some of this:Someone post that the HE400i is one of the lowest distortion headphones out there.  I sure hope not given the above performance!  Here is the same data but shown as absolute distortion level rather than percentage:I have picked the 40 dB as my tentative threshold level.  As we see bass distortion is quite good but we have peaking around 400 Hz and 1.5 kHz.Oh, in case some of you have trouble reading the frequency response chart and want a more ""speaker like"" frequency response, here it is:I use this graph for equalization.  Be careful in the troughs toward the end.  Do not try to boost those as they are likely cancellations due to reflections inside the cups.  We can see this in the group delay graph:Notice how the frequency response errors between 200 and 300 Hz are repeated here.I made quick fixture to measure impedance (better one to come soon when I get the precision resistors I ordered):Note that the above display is highly zoomed.  Otherwise it would look like a flat line which planar magnetic drivers are known for.  As zoomed, the peaks are dependent on how the headphone is mounted.  On my head they were lower in frequency than on the fixture.Hifiman HE400i Headphone Listening TestsAs is, the headphone has a rather ""open"" sound but nowhere near the spatial effects that the Sennheiser HD800S had.  The sound is compressed around a grouping close to my ears.  Tonality seems rather dull and closed in.  So comes out the EQ tools:Wow, what a difference this made.  The sound is now impressive with fantastic dynamics and very clean bass.  Detail is improved substantially.  On my ""speaker killer"" tracks without EQ, I could hardly hear the deep notes.  With EQ on they came to live without the overall tonality sound like ""too much bass.""  Note how I am lifting the frequencies below 50 Hz or so.  It is a bit like adding a subwoofer, not boosting the lows in your speaker.  With EQ, I now get deep bass performance that simply does not exist in any bookshelf speaker.Tracks like Artillery Infected Mushroom sound so much more live with EQ that you can't help but want to bob your head and band on the desk in unison!Then we swing to the other extreme with Kristin Asbj√∏rnsen's wonderful track, Rain, oh Lord:As for the distortions we saw in the graphs, I could tell you that I hear them but I am not sure at all.  The highs sound a bit shrill at moderate levels.  Turning the levels up accentuates this.  But this could just be me not trying to EQ above 8 kHz.  A shelving filter may help there.ConclusionsThis review was prompted by a member suggesting that the Hifiman HE400i can present that interesting spatial quality that the Sennheiser HD800S.  Alas, that is not the case.  Maybe there is a hint of that but not more.  The frequency response of HE400i shows more bass response which is good but also less energy in the important 1 to 3 kHz region.  EQ therefore is mandatory to restore proper balance, resolution, deep bass and detail.  Once there, this is a new headphone, producing a very enjoyable experience.Until I did this test and developed the EQ that you saw, I rarely used the HE400i  But now, I am actually anxious to listen to it more!  I can't get over how ""high fi"" it sounds with equalization!  I will give the HE400i a pass without equalization.  With EQ, I am happy to give the Hifiman HE400i a recommendation.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,490 on Amazon including free shipping.The Focal looks stylistic and modern:I am not sure if I like the fit though.  It has a very stiff headband.  You go from no pressure to a lot of pressure on your head.  That said, after wearing it for a few hours I started to forget about it so not terrible.Whoever designed the cord though was only after looks and not functionality as it is super stiff:At least with those standard connectors, it is easy to make your own or buy aftermarket.The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.I have calibrated my headphone fixture with 94 dBSPL test tones and decided that I use the same for headphone measurements. However, instead of using 1 kHz tone I have opted for 425 Hz. This seems to better match research data.I have also made a lot of progress in building a better test suite for the measurements. More updates and changes will be coming but I am starting to feel good about this set.Focal Clear MeasurementsThere is nothing more important than frequency response of the headphone as each is seemingly different and that difference leaves a very distinct character:Let's cover the good news first: response between 1 and 3 kHz follows our preference curve unlike a number we have tested so far.  Bass response is also higher as well.Misses are the overshoot between 600 and 1.6 Hz.  The lower range of this from my speaker testing usually hides some detail in the music.  There is a flat area as indicated by the arrow.  Clearly, pun intended, the driver is doing something strange there.  Group delay shows similar problem:Here is our deviation from preferred frequency response:For relative distortion, I decided to add a third tier at 114 dBSPL:This way you can see the trend better.  That trend is what we have seen before which is the bass area generating the bulk of the distortion.  And that distortion grows exponentially with level as opposed to linear.  We will revisit distortion in the context of equalization later.Using a log scale and looking at the levels we see our threshold of 40 dBSPL is exceeded mostly in bass frequencies:EDIT: forgot to include the impedance graph:Focal Clear Listening Tests and EqualizationIn some sense the sins of Focal Clear in frequency response is less severe than other headphones we have tested so far.  Naturally, the no-EQ response across my test tracks was decent.  There was some detail lacking and some brightness that was bothersome.  It created fair amount of ""lispiness"" with female vocals for example.I tested small magnitude corrections but soon gave up on them as they didn't seem to be worth the effort.  Instead I went after low hanging fruit:Basically we have some bass boost, some reduction of energy around 1.1 kHz center frequency and lowering of the peak at 11.3 kHz.  The latter was important to get rid of the brightness.The improvement was quite noticeable and pleasant.  More bass helps balance the rest of the response.  Detail resolution improved with the 1.1 kHz filter and as noted, the final 11.3 kHz filter took care of remaining brightness.  There was a cost in distortion but not audibly:As expected, bass distortion shoots up but due to our low sensitivity to such distortion, there was no trade off that I could detect.  The sound simply became warmer and nicer with better reproduction of deep notes.  We naturally gained some distortion reduction with the dip filter around 1.1 kHz (due to broad shoulders it impacts a larger region).First and second tracks sounded good and then BAM!  The headphone jumped its gap resulting in nasty static/crackling sound.  The kind of sound that stops your heart beating for a few seconds!  Basically the driver is running out of travel and going outside of the magnetic field and then jumping back suddenly.  I hear this routinely in cheap bookshelf speakers when driven by high amplification and deep bass.  I could get this to happen even in instrumental/female vocal tracks!Granted, we boosted the EQ but I have boosted EQ much more in other headphones and they can handle with ease.  Not so with Focal Clear.  Still, I turned off the EQ and turned up the volume and there it was again: nasty clicks.  Granted the level was pretty loud now but not outside of what would be listenable.Searching online, I see references to Clear ""clipping.""  I suspect this is what they are talking about.  If so, it is real flaw in this headphone.ConclusionsThe Focal Clear ""out of box"" (no EQ) response is closer to what we like to see so tonality is not too bad as is.  Equalization can take its performance significantly higher but due to poorly designed drivers with too little headroom, this is not a practical path unless you keep volumes low.  Without EQ is less of a problem but you would face some brightness and some lack of clarity.   At these prices we better not have such compromises.I can't recommend the Focal Clear with or without Equalization.  I expect more from a company like Focal with incredible vertical integration to build drivers and such.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $170.The new revision is a bit more serious looking with its matt finish:These are comfortable headphones with their round cups with inside dimension of 58mm diameter.  Depth is 26 mm.  Weight is on the average side:Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was somewhat variable.  I spent quite a bit of time messing with them and what you see is the best I could get.Hifiman HE400i 2020 Version MeasurementsAs usual we start with the headphone frequency response as comparison to our preference curve: I have enclosed the graph for the original version.  There is some difference around 2 kHz with the response a bit higher.  Whether that is measurement error or variations between units, is hard to say.  Not sure why the bass steps down.  I messed with it a ton but that step would not go away.  The rest of the graph is very noisy  unlike any other headphone I have measured.  It is even worse than the original.  I think these are indication of resonances throughout the response.Here is relative frequency response for eq purposes:The roughness of the response and mismatch between channels will make it more challenging to build an EQ.Distortion overall is good but we see a lot of wiggles and bumps in there which I think again indicate resonances:Group delay is very mess which I think indicates many sound sources mixing up and creating it:And for fans of timing response, here is another graph for you:Seems like it is swinging up down for a few cycles before settling down.Finally here is frequency response which remains unchanged:Hifiman HE400i 2020 Listening Tests and EqualizationThe overall sound without EQ is inoffensive.  Let's EQ it though and see if we can improve it:This is based on the older version EQ which I found to be just as good for this revision.  But I spent some time refining it more.  Once done, the sound is very good and enjoyable.ConclusionsTechnically the HE400i has fair number of smaller flaws and mismatch with our target.  As noted though, out of box response is not bad in that it is mostly missing energy than having too much of it.  EQ works but hard to develop a perfect one given the rough response of the headphone.  Still, I managed to get very good response out of them.I am OK with someone buying the HE400i 2020 and use it without EQ.  Personally I would only recommend it if you EQ it.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Finally took the time to plant some flowers this year and results are great!

nan,76fdf09e-586f-4634-b9c8-e1cda88fae8c,Over Ear,Grado,Custom Grado Clone With Elleven Acoustica R1 Driver,17.0,7/18/21,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/custom-grado-clone-with-elleven-acoustica-r1-driver-review.25048/,34.0,"This is a review and detailed measurements of a custom Grado headphone with Elleven Acoustica R1 driver.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  I don't know how much it costs.  The R1 driver is 119 GBP/pair (about US $164).  The gorgeous cups were made by Bruce at Wabi Sabi headphones out of cherry and mahogany.As a woodworker, I find the overall execution simply gorgeous:I am not going to give you the usual physical stats because this is a custom product.  Wearing it, my left hear was touching the driver and this became uncomfortable after about 15 minutes.  Otherwise, they are quite light and easy to wear.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was a bit tricky given the on-ear configuration and lack of measurements elsewhere to confirm fit.  But consistency between channels was surprisingly good so I ran with them.Grado With Elleven Acoustica R1 Driver MeasurementsAs usual, let's start with headphone frequency response measurements:Can you spot the problem?    Sometimes it is this easy. We clearly have a massive peak around 2 kHz that doesn't belong there.  That is followed by a dip.  In addition, we have the bass droop which is common in many headphones.  Here is the relative response for equalization purposes:Distortion is focused in bass as it usually is but also an unfortunately one around 4 kHz:Sadly we need to boost both of those areas so you are dealing with distortion graphs in red or possibly in green depending on how loud you listen.  If you don't EQ and play at low levels, then response is in blue and good.Group delay shows the common messiness which is likely due to reflections back and forth between the driver and the artificial ear in my measurement fixture:Impedance is low and variable:I was surprised how good the efficiency was:It is in IEM class!  Large driver at very close distance to the ear is responsible for that.  Indeed I was able to drive these to reasonable level using the IEM output of my RME ADI-2 Pro DAC and headphone amplifier.Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationInstant reaction to the sound was that it was all wrong.  So I brought out the EQ tool almost immediately:The first three filters had a dramatic effect, completely transforming the sound of this headphone.  Now we had balanced bass, decent spatial qualities and none of that overboosted mid-range.  The highs were a bit distorted -- the same way I have found with other headphones with the same distortion profile in lower treble.  So I added the last filter there in yellow but it didn't seem to make a lot of improvements.ConclusionsNot sure who all has use for all of this data.  I guess you have a sample data point for Eleven Acoustica's R1 driver.  I guess the lesson is that if you are going to build a custom headphone, measurements are essential.  Trying to guess that peak around 2 kHz by ear is darn near impossible.  With measurements and equalization however, you can build a performant headphone and have pride of ownership knowing you built it.P.S.  Sorry about misspelling of ""Acoustica.""  I cut and paste the string as the owner had written and didn't catch it until now.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I purchased this from Amazon and costs US $15.10 including prime shipping (retail $19.99).  I picked this because it was used in Olive et al. research (see below).  Yes, folks, we are getting into measurements of IEMs!    I have a bunch which have come for review and I constantly get offers to test more.  So I finally allocated a bit of time to see how my GRAS 45CA fixture can measure them and to my delight, it was dead easy, far more than any headphone I have measured!  Time will tell however as I measure more whether this is typical or not.To that end, this is also an introductory thread on IEM measurements.  So go ahead and say your peace now and here instead of polluting future review threads.One ""problem"" with IEMs is how to take pictures of them so I apologize for the crappy nature of this one:The dual panther rating means no-EQ on the left, and with EQ on the right.Panasonic RP-TCM-125 MeasurementsGood bit of work was involved in creating the target for IEMs which is different than over or on ear headphones I have tested before.  So do note this as you look at the frequency response graph:Synchronization point of the measurement and preferred reference is around 425 Hz as usual.  I was puzzled by this response thinking I was doing something wrong seeing how the bass response is well above reference and the rest well below.  Fortunately as mentioned, the non-A revision of this headphone was part of the research from Harman.  They don't associate the graphs with the headphones in the paper but man, did I get close to the IEM indicated as ""HP4:""The top graph shows the deviation.  Compare that to mine:Darn close to about 10 kHz, yes?Distortion is very low at 94 and 104 dBSPL:The only point to note is something around 2 to 3 kHz:The fact that we already have plenty of bass and indeed, will be turn down some of that in EQ, we should be in excellent shape with respect to distortion, outperforming many headphones and just about any speaker!Group delay is almost perfect:There is a kink between 200 and 300 Hz which also shows up in frequency response measurements.  I found the same in another IEM I measured.  This may be a measurement artifact so ignore that for now.Impedance is very low by headphone standards at 16 ohm:Fortunately most phones and portable headphone dongles are deficient in voltage and not as much current so they should be able to drive this IEM easily.  Here is its sensitivity:As I get more IEMs tested, I will create a bar graph dedicated to them.Panasonic RP-TCM-125 Listening TestsFor measurements I had used the middle sized silicone tip that came preinstalled.  They fit perfectly in the measurement fixture.  On my ears though, even though they stayed put, there was no bass at all.  In that regard, it didn't sound too horrible.  Since I usually wear larger tips, I swapped out the larger size.  Oh man, I was not prepared for how horrid these sounded now!  Bass became overwhelming like I have not heard before.  The rest of the spectrum almost got buried.  As much as I like bass, this was just wrong on many levels.  So out came the EQ tool in Roon player I use:The errors are large so I eyeballed pretty large corrections.  The transformation was incredible!  I am listening to them as I type this.  The sound is so detailed, clean and with incredible sub-bass capability that puts a smile on my face on every track!  On the ones with high dynamics, the result is startling on tracks like Games from Hans Zimmer Wonder Woman 1984 soundtrack:It is stunning what fidelity you get!  More fine tuning is needed to tame a bit of brightness that exists post EQ but man, what is there is so satisfying I can't wipe off the smile from my face!Yes, there is no spatial qualities like you get with some headphones.  And bass is not tactile like it is on speaker.  But high fidelity it is.  This bodes well for overall correctness of the target response.ConclusionsSo we enter a new chapter in ASR by testing IEMs.  I use mine for a few hours in bed to watch youtube videos in bed so they are essential component to test and review.  With respect to this Panasonic, clearly this is tuned to go after bass which they think sells.  Maybe this is because they know most people wear these loose so need that extra punch.  Result is quite bad given the deficiency above 500 Hz.  But apply equalization and this thing pretties up like nobody's business.  I look forward to testing more IEMs but for now, I can't stop being impressed with the sound I am getting out of this $15 IEM!Without EQ, you want to avoid this headphone at all cost.  With EQ, the Panasonic RP-TCM125 easily lands in my recommended list.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was sent to me by the company and costs US $255 on Amazon including Prime shipping.I must say, this is one attractive looking headphone!The padding and soft surfaces feel luxurious as well.  Reminds me of the inside of an Audi automobile!I absolutely love the fact that they indicate the channel designation both in large letters inside and on the sides:On some headphones it literally takes me a minute or two to find the darn designation.The headphone is also fairly light at just 300 grams.  Cups are round as you see with a diameter of 58 mm.  The depth is variable and at the shallowest end is 17 mm which is not a lot.  If you have your ears poking out, it may touch dust cover.The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.Getting a good fit was super easy with both channels matching each other at my two targets on the first install.Sivgo Phoenix MeasurementsThere is nothing more important than frequency response of a headphone as each is seemingly different and that difference leaves a very distinct character:We almost have a match for our target between 100 and 500 Hz but above and below that range we have a shortfall.  The higher frequency loss will likely translate into a dull sounding headphone.  There is however enough bass for it to not sound light in that department.Relative chart may be easier for some to understand even though it conveys the same information as above:Basic emphasis here then is the region between 200 and 300 Hz.Relative distortion shows what we see from typical headphones in bass but there is also some disturbance in 3 to 6 kHz:Fortunately since we have good bit of upper bass energy, we won't be boosting that so what we see is what we get:Group delay is not revealing:Impedance is variable but low which means typical portable devices should be able to drive it:That is especially so since the Phoenix is the most sensitive headphone I have measured so far:Sivga Phoenix Listening TestsFirst impression was not positive: the sound is dull with most emphasis in lower frequencies.  I had to pull up the parametric EQ right away to get it to be more correct.   This is a quick and dirty attempt at fixing the gross problems:Broad corrections will probably benefit from mathematical correction than my manual one.  Still, the improvement was dramatic in both balanced sound and better spatial imaging.  Female vocals that were lost before now came out front and center as they should.ConclusionsThe measured performance of Phoenix headphone shows broad deviations from out preference target.  Subjective listening tests confirmed the same resulting in strong amount of EQ.  The outcome was positive but not super exciting.While I like the look and feel of the Sivga Phoenix, the overall performance is not good enough for me to recommend it.  If you own it, I highly recommend using equalization to get better fidelity.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $200.  I understand it is identical to Meze 99 Classic which the company sells for a lot more money. The 99 Noir has a quirky look that is unique and for me, comfortable:Dual mono 3.5 mm removable plugs are provided which fit very tightly.  They are long and narrow so if you need to replace them, you have to get something that is the same.  The 99 Noir is pretty light headphone at 270 grams.  Inside cup dimensions are 65x50x19 (height x weight x depth).The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.Getting a good fit was easy with both channels matching each other at my two targets on the first install.Massdrop x Meze 99 Noir MeasurementsThere is nothing more important than frequency response of a headphone as each is seemingly different and that difference leaves a very distinct character:Wow, that is some bass!  While I don't mind it having a lot of sub-bass, what is after that is clearly way too much.  There is also a hole between 2 and 4 kHz.The owner also sent me a set of BRAINWAVZ Micro Suede Ear Pads.  I had much more difficulty getting the two channels to match but after the fact I discovered that one pad wasn't mounted tight:Assuming these are not run to run variations, the two issues identified with stock pads are much less severe now.Back to original pads, here is the relative frequency response:There is distortion in bass but considering that we will be taking that down in EQ, the 99 Noir may have very good response there:I wish we didn't have the disturbance around 3 to 6 kHz though which also exceeds my target in absolute terms:Group delay shows some naughtiness in bass:Impedance is flat and low:I was surprised that the spec is 32 ohm.  I am too lazy to remeasure so I wonder if someone knows if there has been changes in the driver.This is one sensitive headphone requiring IEM-like power to play:Massdrop x Meze 99 Noir Headphone Listening TestsI always start with my female audio tracks and the first track there, does not have much bass.  What little it had got warmer so I didn't mind that.  The highs on the other hand sounded a bit ""tizzy"" (yes, this is a technical term!).  I then jumped a couple of tracks to one that had bass and boy, there definitely was way too much of it.  So out came the parametric EQ tool:Yes there are a lot of filters there.  Transformation was dramatic though.  Not only was the bass far more balanced now, overall spatial qualities improved hugely.  Gone were the recessed vocals and you now had a open, and very pleasant soundstage.  I left the deep bass uncompensated and that brought delight to my ears as I listened to my tracks with such content in there!    I don't think there is too much sub-bass in my book.  Once there, I sat there enjoying track after track in my library.  As a matter of fact I am listening to them as I type this.ConclusionsThere is no question that out of the box the Meze 99 Noir is hugely flawed headphone, both objectively and subjectively.  It is not annoying though as long as the bass does not distort for you.  Add half a dozen filters by eye as I did and what you get is very enjoyable, hi-fi experience.  It is like taking a F student and bringing him up to B+.  Combine that with the light weight and overall comfort, and you have a something that can be a very good headphone.I cannot recommend the Massdrop x Meze 99 Noir without EQ.  With EQ, I am happy to do so.  If yo have this headphone and are not using EQ to fix its flaws, you are missing out big time.  Assuming my measurements are correct, and you don't want to use EQ, at least get the replacement pads and see if it fixes things a bit.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly ordered by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $349.Verum is a one-person DIY originated design and company. There is controversy around the owner which you can read here. Please don't comment on it in this thread. Company is located in Ukraine sadly.It has a custom look which belies its low cost.The headphone is large but somehow doesn't seem heavy despite its weight:Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the measurement fixture was easy.Verum Audio Verum 1 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:I was impressed by the exact channel matching.  Compliance is good for reasonable range in audio band.  Bass as is the case with many headphones, doesn't rise up to our preference target.  There is also shortfall of energy  between 1.5 and 7 kHz.  In relative terms, it looks like this:There is almost no distortion at 94 dBSPL across the full frequency band (blue):But then we get narrow spikes in mid frequencies which tend to suggest resonances.  We can see correlation with this (a weak one) in group delay:Here is our distortion in absolute levels:Impedance is flat but exceptionally low:Fortunately this is counteracted with very high sensitivity:Verum One Listening Tests and EqualizationOut of box response is good with nothing that would be bothersome at all.  On female vocals, I found it very acceptable as there is not a lot of bass in those tracks.  As usual though, I like to use EQ to get close to our target:Spatial qualities and naturally bass response improved now.  Detail was excellent and overall experience very enjoyable.I tried to tease out the mid frequency distortion but I could not.  Bass response was so strong at high volumes that I feared for my ears.    My RME ADI-2 DAC had no trouble pushing this headphone even at -10 to -15 dB.ConclusionsI can't fathom how a single person could design and manufacture these headphones yet sell them for just $349.  Response out of box is good enough that you could use them if you have no EQ ability.  With EQ, their performance rises to quite a high level, putting a smile on my face.I am going to recommend the Verum One headphone without EQ and strongly so with EQ.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
250,9b207942-30ca-4949-b9b1-0dd7cd01e0ce,Over-Ear,NAD,Viso HP50,55.0,1/5/21,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/nad-viso-hp50-review-headphone.19121/,39.0," NAD HP50 headphone.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  While NAD still lists this headphone, it doesn't seem to be available at retailers.  Instead, there are some being sold on ebay.  I think new they were going for $300 but ebay seller has certified refurbished for $179 normally.  But apparently they frequently go on sale down to just $89 which is what the member paid.  The packaging and headphone look brand new so they must be clearance stock.I like the modern look of the headphone:Notice how the two cups are hanging differently from each other.  This is because the headband is not symmetrical.  This, combined with rather small cups made getting consistent results between the two channels impossible.  Also, when you expand the headband, it will become rather square, giving you a Frankenstein look.  My monitor is not reflective so I was good with that!An interesting twist on this headphone which I appreciated is that you can plug in its diminutive cord into either headphone socket:The cord is ultra light but very short.  I guess it is made for portable use.  I managed to pull it out of my amplifier as I moved around.  Fortunately you can replace it yourself with a longer cord.NAD Viso HP50 MeasurementsI was surprised to see the frequency response of the HP50 having such a big shortfall in the upper midrange/treble region:From testing countless speakers with deficiency in this area I can tell you that it takes the fun and sparkle out of your music.Judging bass response is a crapshoot due to highly challenging fit to my Gras 45C artificial ears.  Slightest movement would make the response vary a ton.  And due to headband expanding asymmetrically, you couldn't get both cups to fit properly at at the same time and at low and high frequencies.  So the above is a sample fit and we need to use judgement in equalization.Going with what we have, this is our deviation from our preference target curve:As see, the variation is quite large so no sense in bickering about the preference curve.  No matter how you look at it, this headphone has a sucked out response in that region.There is some peaking around 12 kHz but it is narrow.  Since my test fixture de-emphasizes that region, I think it may merit a bit of correction.Distortion is very low in bass and in general if you don't get the thing too loud:It is interesting to observe those narrow peaks.In absolute terms and using 94 dBSPL at our reference, distortion is comfortably below my threshold of 40 dBSPL:Group delay is somewhat instructive here, showing discontinuities where we have some frequency response variations:Otherwise it gives us license to equalize the response as we see fit especially in the 1 to 10 kHz region.  There are no sharp spiked that would tell us otherwise.Impedance is more or less flat:When you look at my headphone measurements, you should look at the performance relative to 33 ohm load I use for testing as that is the closes match.Sensitivity is excellent meaning you need very little power:NAD HP50 Headphone Listening TestsOut of the box, there is nothing offensive about the sound.  We could have told this from the frequency response as not much exceeds our target response and distortion is quite low.  After a few seconds of adjustment, you notice the closed, bass heavy sound.  So let's not waste more time and apply some judicious correction based on frequency response:The filters make substantial improvements with the exception of the 12.1 kHz one. You could leave it out if you wanted.Wow, what a transformation.  This thing takes to equalization like a duck takes to water.  Not only do we have beautiful bass, midrange and treble now, it is all squeakily clean.  And as a huge bonus, spatial qualities (i.e. ""soundstage"") improve substantially since a lot of stereo cues are in the 1 to 5 kHz we have boosted.Don't quote me on this -- I like to get paid if you do! -- but I think this headphone has angled drivers?  If so, that and equalization must be behind the open, oval sphere above your head and on each side.  Panned instruments position themselves to the left and right while the mono vocals take front top center stage.  Not Sennheiser HD800S category but we are talking about some of that flavor.  I have to tell you, post equalization I did not want to stop listening to the HP50!  As a matter of fact it is the next day and I am listening to it as I am typing this review!A word on comfort: it seems to have loosened up a bit today and become more comfortable.  Yesterday I would rate it at 80% comfort.  Had to take my glasses off since the headphone relies on rather strong clamp pressure to stay on your head.  The headband stays proud even at the lowest extension of the cups.  So personally I am not sure if I could use it all day if it did not continue to loosen up.Sound isolation is good but not as good as my larger closed headphones.ConclusionsWhat a hidden jewel post equalization!  At sale price of $89 it is a steal relative to its smooth, low distortion and quality of sound it provides.  It is not as comfortable as large cups on higher end headphones but you may be OK with it.  With the high efficiency you should also be able to drive these with many portable devices.All this said, I can't recommend the NAD HP50 without EQ.  With EQ however, I am here go give it a strong recommendation especially considering the price.  Heck, I would even take the price out of the equalization!------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member.  It is currently discontinued and seems to have come out back in 2012, costing US $230.  Time has not been kind to the specific sample I received which suffered from significant wear:Anything that can wear out in it, has.  It looks better in these pictures than in person:The included cable has four pins and includes a microphone.Overall comfort is good.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Mounting the headphone on my test fixture was challenging, resulting in quite a lot of variation between channels and overall response. I optimized this as best as I could but like there are some error in low frequencies.PSB M4U 1 MeasurementsLet's start with frequency response of M4U-1 and comparison to our preference target to figure out tonality of the headphone: I looked for measurements from others and only found a couple which showed much elevated bass than what I got.  We will have to verify who is right with listening tests.  Taken as is, bass is obviously deficient as critical range between 1 and 5 kHz which has a strong influence on spatial qualities and presentation of female vocals.I expect the sound to be rather dull and uninteresting but also not annoying due to highs being controlled.Distortion was remarkably low:High-end headphones with tons of distortion should take note!  The low distortion should give us freedom to boost the holes in frequency response without fear negative consequences on that front.Group delay shows messiness below 1 kHz which we also saw in frequency response:As always, massive spikes in high frequencies indicates reflections inside the cup and not a sign of frequency response errors.  So don't be tempted to narrowband correction.Impedance is flat but also low so current delivery matters:Then again, this is one efficient headphone:So you should be able to use it on just about any source.PBS M4U1 Headphone Listening TestsThe M4U1 sounds exactly like it measures.  Nothing annoying but not too exciting either.  I pulled out the parametric EQ in my Roon player and dialed in some sub-bass EQ and that fit like a glove.  Added a quick filter for 1 to 5 kHz and job was basically done:I had my son here so had him listen and he voted thumbs up on both fronts and the fact that the sound was not boomy or bass heavy post EQ.I wanted to do more listening but alas, Roon folks just broke Tidal integration causing me to have a fraction of my test clips available for testing.   Based on what I did hear, with EQ, the sound was quite good.  The boost between 1 and 5 kHz opened the soundstage and detail/instrument layering.  The boost in bass was good although not quite substantial.  It could stand accepting more based on taste.ConclusionsThe M4U1 has clear response errors that fortunately are correctable using EQ due to very low distortion.  Good results can be had as a result.  The problem is that the headphone itself seems to age poorly so not sure about getting a used one.  Anyway, you have the data to make a decision.Since the PSB M4U 1 is a discontinued item without performance that jumps out at you, I can't recommend it.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I purchased this last summer and it currently costs US $149 on Amazon including shipping.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, carries various Harman brand products although not the AKG products.The K371 is made out of plastic but has a nice finish which belies its cheap structure:I especially like the feel of the pads.  They are not huge but big enough to fit around my ears.  Inside height of the pad is 2.51 inches.  Inside width is 1.62 inches.  With no depression, the pad depth to the driver is 0.8 inches.  Outside diameter of the pad is 4 inches by 3 inches.Three different cords are supplied which terminate into a 3-pin mini-XLR:Let me warn you about something I hate about these headphones: the headband adjustment mechanism.  It either gets stuck and doesn't move at all.  Or all of a sudden moves a bunch of notches.  I also see reports of the mechanism failing which means you have to send them back to Harman/AKG for repair (you pay shipping even under warranty).Clamp pressure is a bit much especially if you wear glasses at first but gets better with some use.  When I take them off, the pads are quite warm so likely in summer, they will not be comfortable if your room is not cool.Note 1: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people doing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture.Getting the K371 seated did not require much work and indeed, measurements track some of the others I have seen using same fixture as I use.AKG K371 Measurements As usual we start with frequency response of K371.  They are said to follow the Harman target.  Let's see if that is the case:This looks to be closest we have gotten to the target.  Indeed in sub-bass where vast majority of headphones fall off, the K371 actually overachieves a bit.  Then again the Harman fixture is a bit different than what the rest of us use so maybe in their fixture that was right on the money.  Either way, during equalization and listening tests we will investigate this further.Following down the curve, we have a dip around 3.8 to 3.9 kHz.   It is a shame as past that the response envelop more or less follows our target.We can subtract the response from the target and see the deviations:Distortion is better than average:The 94 dB line in blue shows extremely good performance.  That keeps up even at 104 dBSPL.Edit: forgot to include the absolute measurements:Group delay gives us some clues to things going wrong with manifested in frequency response graph:We get similar clues in impedance versus frequency:This is a very sensitive headphone so don't need much horsepower to drive it:AKG K371 Headphone Listening Tests & EQFirst impression was a very good response albeit, with a tad too much bass and a bit of exaggerated highs and harshness.  You really had to listen to find these though.  I also found the vocals to be a tiny bit recessed.  Overall, you could listen to these headphones and be perfectly fine without any equalization.But we, at least I, want perfection so let's apply a bit of touch up as instructed by the frequency response:I first boosted the lower treble and while that opened the sound up and nicely increased detail, the sound became somewhat bright.  So I went after one of the peaks at 6800 and pulled that down.  That fixed most of that.  I initially had the bass pulled down some as you see in Band 1 crossed out above.  I turned that off as it nicely countered the slightly sharpness that was left.  Once there, this headphone was absolutely delightful to listen to.  I could only find the slightest amount of harshness left (which could be magnification of what is in the music).It was such a pleasure to listen to music with deep bass with and without EQ and hear those notes resonate in my ear even at very modest playback levels.  Tracks likeNachtschw√§rmen, by Regen:Tropfen were stunning in their impulsive bass notes:And so was the rest of the spectrum.  Notes come from every end of spectrum at no time do you say, ""oh, why is that too high or too low.""  It is all balanced to near perfection.Spatially without EQ the experience is fine.  My boost of the lower treble however helps a lot here to get very good ""soundstage"" and layering of instruments.  Mind you, it is not crazy nice like that if Sennheiser HD800s and such but it is ""correct"" and satisfying.ConclusionsSome of you have been asking, even demanding to see a headphone that does the job without EQ.  Well, the AKG K371 is it.  My equalizations of it are subtle (but worthwhile) so you could indeed live without it.  I do however highly recommend that you deploy EQ if you can.You could say I am rubber stamping the Harman research and approach to headphone tonality.  But such was not the case.  I went into this review critically and thinking hard about what rating to give the headphone.  I almost notched it down one step to avoid accusation of bias.  But at the end, the truth is the truth.  Years of research by Harman has resulted in creating headphone tonality that matches what I dream about getting out of best speakers in the world.  To the extent their research goes after that sound (tonality of a good speaker in the room), it is natural that Harman and I land in the same spot.Note that my strong positive recommendation for AKG K371 is for sound only.  Physically, this headphone may not do it for you.  It may get too hot around your ears, and the adjustment mechanism may annoy you or break.  I leave that to you to decide.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I think they sold for $120???These don't look too bad although clearly made to seem nicer than they are:A single slim 3.5mm cable connects the headphone to your amplifier.  One channel in the headphone was dead.  I could not replace the cable because the ones I have don't fit in the hole for the cable.

Response goes everywhere it wants.  If it didn't have the dip at 300 Hz it would not be that bad.  Interestingly the Group Delay shows something is amiss at that frequency as well:Distortion is quite high across the board:Sensitivity is good:Impedance swing and dip way low, not so much:Headphone Listening Tests and EQWith just one cup playing, it was hard to get enough volume to listen without risking damage in that one ear.  Still, I was able to do some evaluation.  Surprisingly, the sound is not as awful as it seems to the eye.  The boost in bass region makes up for the lack of deep bass to some extent for example.  Still, equalization was quite effective:As you can see, the entire frequency range is being modified here.  So not where you want to go unless you have to.ConclusionsThis headphone is classic ""selling by parts"" kind of products.  It has dual drivers including a electrostatic driver so it must be good.  Well, it is not.  It doesn't follow any kind of proper frequency response.  Distortion is high.  And with one channel being dead out of the box, quality control seems quite lacking.I can't recommend the Verisonix Pro DJ N1502C headphone.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was sent to me by the company and costs US $55.I was relieved that they are more mahogany/darker red than what the name implies.  Compared to the previous Zero version, they are supposed to have slightly different frequency response and lower distortion. We will test both.  Different silicone tips are included. Here are the sets I used for testing:Measurement set was recommended by the company and are the same ones that I used for original Truthear Crinacle Zero IEM review.If you are new to my testing, please watch this video on headphone measurements.Truthear x Crinacle Zero:RED MeasurementsAs usual we start with our frequency response measurement:That is very good match to our target with just a bit less bass. The original zero had slightly more energy in the 2 to 5 kHz:Given the precise matching to our frequency response, the differential to our target is quite small and limited to bass:Edit: there is an inline resistor which reduces sensitivity some but effectively boosts bass:I was happy to see nice reduction in distortion:That's incredibly low distortion even at 114 dBSPL!  Love it....The dual elements and crossover within cause non-flat frequency response:Company takes advantage of this by including an inline resistor adapter which would cause more losses where impedance is low.  This means you get less highs or put the other way, you get more bass, albeit with some power loss. I would not mess with the adapter.Group delay is non revealing as is the case with most IEMs:The Red remains in the class of less sensitive IEMs:Truthear x Crinacle Zero:RED Listening TestsI was so anxious to start listening to these but imagine my surprise when the first track sounded anything but correct.  I quickly realized bass was not there and bam, I had forgotten to go to the next size up!  Did that and immediate joy was to be had with accurate and deep bass complimenting the higher frequencies.  The low distortion and detail gave me goosebumps sometimes.I did find the sound a bit closed so I dialed in a low Q (2) 1 to 2 dB gain filter centered at 3 kHz.  This substantially improved the spatial effects.  But also caused some brightness at times.  The designer expressed dissatisfaction with the original Zero's higher response and lowering it in this revision.  I think the truth, pun intended, is somewhere in the middle.  EDIT: in the original review, I used the wrong target which showed great matching with target in bass.  With the correct target, we see a bit of bass deficiency which would explain why boosting treble caused brightness.ConclusionsFolks, we have another reference class IEM for hardly any money. Yes, there is a bit different tuning but whether that is better or not, is hard to determine given the uncertainty in measurements, and listening preference at granular level.  I am happy with either but like the lower distortion in RED.  If I want more spatial effects, I can dial up the mid treble. I could not reduce distortion the original Zero.  So the RED gets my vote as to the better of the two by small margin.It is my pleasure to add Truthear x Crinacle Zero RED to my recommended list.  Skip a lunch or two out and put this in your arsenal even if you are not a regular IEM user.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly loaned to me by a member and costs US $399 from the company.While the feel of the pads is nice, I am not sure I got any cuteness inferences from the name ""Panda:""The spring tension is extremely progressive going from little resistance to massive amounts.  The soft pads help a lot but I did not like wearing them.  They bothered me from start and stayed that way.  The small cups and heavy weight of the unit despite its size do not help in this regard.  We are at 380 grams with inside cup dimensions of 59x40x20 (Height x Width x Depth).A removable 3.5 mm cable is provided for wired connectivity.  Online measurements and reports indicate the same response wired and wireless so I did all of my testing wired (lossy codecs can change the frequency response). The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers specially in bass and a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.NOTE: I had a hell of a time getting consistent measurements out of this headphone.  Slight touch to the headphone would often send the response in one channel down by 20 dB!  I thought the cable was loose or broken but moving that alone did not help.  After many tries, I got lucky and got one consistent measurement you see below.  After I did the measurements, I read the note from the owner that indicated people complaining about this very thing.  I am thinking there is a design problem in the wired pass-through mode of this headphone which needs to be addressed.Drop + THX Panda MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:As usual, I try to sync up the measurement to the frequency of 425 Hz which is the zero reference for the preference curve.  Doing so shows the good compliance to target from 80 Hz to 700 Hz.  Other measurements I have seen online sync up to 1 kHz and as a result show sub-bass and 1 to 5 kHz much closer to target with a massive boost showing between 80 to 700 Hz.  Remember, this is just a visual aid.  The measurements and what the headphone is doing is the same either way. You can see the broad deviation in relative graph just the same:In my book, this kind of response is a mistake.  Deep bass is a fundamental advantage a headphone can have because it is free of room modes that speakers suffer from.  And at any rate, speakers struggle to reproduce sub-bass.  Headphones if designed well can do this with ease.  The broad dip between 1 and 6 kHz suck the openness life out of a headphone and is another sin in my book.  Drop raves about not having DSP in there to process the sound.  DSP is exactly what this headphone needs to produce anything close to preferred tonality.Distortion is quite low:Then again we need to boost the very areas that are highest in distortion so above graph is somewhat misleading if you are going to use EQ.Group delay is very clean except for bass (which is typical):Impedance is flat and low:Headphone is very sensitive:Although subjectively I kept turning up the level to compensate for frequency response errors.Drop + THX Panda Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationI couldn't listen for more than a few seconds to Panda before reaching for EQ.  So much of the life of the music is sucked out in mid frequencies without it.  A quick fix for that region with a single filter improved things but not remotely where it needed to be.  Took a good half of hour of tuning with more filters to get reasonable sound out of this headphone:With all these fixes, the sound was quite pleasant and much more open with far better spatial qualities.  Still, I was not in the mood to listen much to the headphone and took them off.ConclusionsThe Panda gets so many things wrong here.  It is not comfortable to wear, and has very poor frequency response curve.  Equalization helps a lot but in my attempt at least, could not remove the bad tastes of the sound without EQ.  There are so many other choices of headphones out there that I don't see a reason to use this headphone.  Equalization is a must for this headphone and needed to be there day one (I understand they are releasing an App with EQ soon).  Given how much experience Drop has with selling other headphones, I am so surprised that their internal process did not catch the many flaws this headphone has.  Yes, there was a time that having ""THX"" on any audio gear was a major advantage.

It was kindly loaned to me by a member and costs US $399 from the company.While the feel of the pads is nice, I am not sure I got any cuteness inferences from the name ""Panda:""The spring tension is extremely progressive going from little resistance to massive amounts.  The soft pads help a lot but I did not like wearing them.  They bothered me from start and stayed that way.  The small cups and heavy weight of the unit despite its size do not help in this regard.  We are at 380 grams with inside cup dimensions of 59x40x20 (Height x Width x Depth).A removable 3.5 mm cable is provided for wired connectivity.  Online measurements and reports indicate the same response wired and wireless so I did all of my testing wired (lossy codecs can change the frequency response). The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers specially in bass and a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.NOTE: I had a hell of a time getting consistent measurements out of this headphone.  Slight touch to the headphone would often send the response in one channel down by 20 dB!  I thought the cable was loose or broken but moving that alone did not help.  After many tries, I got lucky and got one consistent measurement you see below.  After I did the measurements, I read the note from the owner that indicated people complaining about this very thing.  I am thinking there is a design problem in the wired pass-through mode of this headphone which needs to be addressed.Drop + THX Panda MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:As usual, I try to sync up the measurement to the frequency of 425 Hz which is the zero reference for the preference curve.  Doing so shows the good compliance to target from 80 Hz to 700 Hz.  Other measurements I have seen online sync up to 1 kHz and as a result show sub-bass and 1 to 5 kHz much closer to target with a massive boost showing between 80 to 700 Hz.  Remember, this is just a visual aid.  The measurements and what the headphone is doing is the same either way. You can see the broad deviation in relative graph just the same:In my book, this kind of response is a mistake.  Deep bass is a fundamental advantage a headphone can have because it is free of room modes that speakers suffer from.  And at any rate, speakers struggle to reproduce sub-bass.  Headphones if designed well can do this with ease.  The broad dip between 1 and 6 kHz suck the openness life out of a headphone and is another sin in my book.  Drop raves about not having DSP in there to process the sound.  DSP is exactly what this headphone needs to produce anything close to preferred tonality.Distortion is quite low:Then again we need to boost the very areas that are highest in distortion so above graph is somewhat misleading if you are going to use EQ.Group delay is very clean except for bass (which is typical):Impedance is flat and low:Headphone is very sensitive:Although subjectively I kept turning up the level to compensate for frequency response errors.Drop + THX Panda Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationI couldn't listen for more than a few seconds to Panda before reaching for EQ.  So much of the life of the music is sucked out in mid frequencies without it.  A quick fix for that region with a single filter improved things but not remotely where it needed to be.  Took a good half of hour of tuning with more filters to get reasonable sound out of this headphone:With all these fixes, the sound was quite pleasant and much more open with far better spatial qualities.  Still, I was not in the mood to listen much to the headphone and took them off.ConclusionsThe Panda gets so many things wrong here.  It is not comfortable to wear, and has very poor frequency response curve.  Equalization helps a lot but in my attempt at least, could not remove the bad tastes of the sound without EQ.  There are so many other choices of headphones out there that I don't see a reason to use this headphone.  Equalization is a must for this headphone and needed to be there day one (I understand they are releasing an App with EQ soon).  Given how much experience Drop has with selling other headphones, I am so surprised that their internal process did not catch the many flaws this headphone has.  Yes, there was a time that having ""THX"" on any audio gear was a major advantage.  But that technology is of no use if you get the basics of the design wrong.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Drop + THX Panda.  If you have it, you need to use EQ and put pressure on Drop to investigate whatever is wrong with signaling of this headphone in one channel.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $385 on amazon.The P5 has very unusual design showing innovation in how you build a lightweight headphone:New Zealand lamb leather is used on the pads and headband providing very soft touch and feel.  It is extremely comfortable when you wear it.  After a couple of hours, I could feel a bit of discomfort but no more than any other headphone.Innovations continue inside the headphone where a clever mechanism is used to hide the removable cable inside one of the cups (which are magnetically mounted):Perhaps because of that, I found the cable to be more than usual microphonic.  This is a ""sealed"" headphone even though it sits on your ear.  I found that this was enough to get rid of the high pitch whine of my computer fan but not the TV in the room next door.  So good in this regrard.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Bowers & Wilkins P5 MeasurementsLet's start with frequency response of P5 and comparison to our preference target to figure out tonality of the headphone: As noted, optimally placing an on-ear headphone on the test fixture is an impossible task.  I was pleasantly surprised though that I managed to get both channels to match each other almost perfectly despite this.  Normally I set the reference level of 94 dB to 425 Hz but got unlucky in this case as the bass resonance is located at that very frequency.  So I moved the reference to 600 Hz to get better matching.We are clearly bass deficient although how much, we don't know due to fitment issues (and listener preference).    We get decent tracking of our target past a few hundred hertz but then have another shortfall above 4 kHz.  Without bass and treble, this is likely going to be a unexciting headphone to listen to:I fell off my chair when I saw incredibly low distortion almost independent of level:As noted the extremely low distortion means there are no nasty side-effects to using EQ to boost things.  In absolute level, we see how incredibly low distortion is at higher frequencies relative to our target of 40 dB:Bass distortion is also good but the level is very slow.  Once we boost that in EQ, the advantage there gets erased.Impedance is flat and low:Sensitivity is excellent so you should be able to power the P5 with just about anything:Finally, group delay shows the sane response of the driver above bass:Bowers & Wilkins P5 Listening Tests and EqualizationThe P5 sounds exactly as the measurements predict: too little bass and highs.  As such, it is not offensive at all.  Just dull and unexciting.  If you want to use it for long term background music listening, it would be fine as is.  That is not me though so I pulled out EQ tool and in just a couple minutes had a completely different headphone:I quickly dialed in that bass boost to the tune of 8 dB and it was perfect.  I then put in two filters to pull up the highs, adjusted them up and down a bit and I was done!  Sure, you could mess with them more but there was no need in my book.  Once there, the sound was very enjoyable.  Combine that with the light weight of this headphone and feeling of luxury wearing it, it is hard to ask for a lot more.ConclusionsThe Bowers & Wilkins P5 headphone is a bit of sleeper as far as measurements and listening results.  Dial in some EQ to taste though and it wakes up and becomes a contended for a very comfortable and lightweight headphone.I can recommend the Bowers & Wilkins P5 with equalization.  Without it, it is a pass.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Voice feedback is provided for actions which helps.  Turning up the volume for example requires brushing up on one of the cups. This is a light headphone although the price for that is is rather small pads:Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was very tricky.  The pads are ultra soft and you can easily deform them and have them hold their shape that way.  This made relatively large differences from bass all the way up to almost 1 kHz.Status Flagship ANC MeasurementsWith ANC headphones, we need to first establish if we are going to test them wired off or wired on as the latter can invoke DSP and change the response:As you can see, that is the case here with red color indicating the headphone being on.  In this mode, it hugs are preference curve well.  Without it, it is a disaster.  So for follow on test, I left the unit on.  I also played with the mounting to get rid of that resonance at 30 Hz:I also fiddled with the level fair bit to reduce the amount of equalization we have to perform.  Net results puts a smile on my face with respect to amount of bass available.    We are just missing some energy around 2 to 5 kHz.  Here is our relative curve for equalization purposes:Being in active mode, it is easy to overdrive the unit, or cause its amplifier to clip:The main issue of concern is the peaking around 4 kHz which unfortunately is the area we need to boost:Group delay shows us one key information: the amount of pipeline delay:Impedance when on is a reasonable middle of the road 150 ohm:Without it as noted, it will drop to 30 some ohm so a very different animal.  I only measured sensitivity when on which naturally is good:So should be easy to drive with many sources.Status Flagship ANC Listening Tests and EqualizationI started listening with the headphone off and it was horrific.  I immediately turned it on and man, what a transformation!  If I had not attempted to EQ it, I have called it right and be done with it.  But still, we always need to verify measurements by applying EQ to deficiencies and see if we like the result better:At first I put in two filters, the one above and a much narrower one after it.  That made the headphone too bright so I ditched the second one.  With this one filter, the sound was now more open and lighter which I like. Once there, the experience was super nice.  I could once again get may ear lobes to resonate which is a tall order for ANC headphones.  Sit back down... I only do that for a second to see if the headphone clips or not.  And the Flagship ANC did not. On distortion, I thought the highs were a tad gritty.  Whether this is my imagination or manifestation of what we measured, I can't tell you.There is a bit of spatial qualities here there but not much.Testing the ANC functionality, it allowed about 10% of the fan noise from my Audio Precision in.  Best in class ANCs are dead quiet.  It is good enough though.ConclusionsWhat a pleasure to see a budget priced noise cancelling headphone have proper bass and matching to most of our preference curve out of the box.  The little bit that it is missing you could do without if you don't have EQ.  But if you do, it does improve things.  We are just a hair away from excellence here, mainly due to a bit of distortion in highs which I perceived.I am happy to recommend the Status Flagship ANC when powered on.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased by a member from Amazon and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $278 including Prime shipping.  It comes in three colors; this one is black:I like the feel of the unit.  Seems high quality.  The detents in the slide mechanism is not strong so adjusting it was a bit of a pain.This headphone has 1000 features which I won't be covering here but as a quick example, has a proximity sensor in one of the cups so it can shut itself off when you take it off your head.There is a cord to use it hardwired without the unit being on but as you will see, the story here is complex.These are the dimensions:Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people doing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture.   Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.  Fitting the WH-1000XM4 on the measurement fixture was very challenging.  Slightest movement and variation would make a large change in response.  I got lucky in that all of a sudden, both channels locked together indicating at least balanced mounting.  So that is what I ran with.  I suggest you look at the high level picture per above even more than usual.Sony WH-1000XM4 MeasurementsAs usual, let's start with the WH-1000MX4 frequency response in passive mode (electronics turned off):Ouch, ouch, ouch!  What on earth is that huge hump between 100 and 200 Hz?  That, combined with the large dip between 2 and 3 kHz is going to make this sound muffled and unpleasant.  Switching the unit on causes massive transformation for the better:Levels shifted way up and I forgot to compensate for it.  So imagine the curve is pulled down a few dB.  Then you see that the bass response is more or less is following the preference target.   We still have a peak around 800 Hz to deal with and the same dip around 2 kHz  but we are much closer to where we need to be.I guess this confirms that Sony knows the response is broken without DSP and left it that way assuming (correctly) that most people will use this with noise cancellation on.  And if Sony can fix the bass with EQ, so can we!From here on, I am going to show the passive performance until we get to listening tests.  Here is our relative response:Can you say deeply colored?  I knew you could.  We have whopping 24 dB deviation from our target.  No matter which way you skin this, and how much inaccuracy you want to read into the measurements, this is way off any kind of proper frequency response.  Pretty sure this is the worse we have seen so far in any headphone.Distortion is present but at low levels, it should be OK:Impedance is both low and variable:As noted, the moment you turn on the headphone, it becomes a different animal because then you are feeding the input of the ADC and the internal amplifier is then driving the headphone.  Sadly, because the internal amp is battery powered, it is anemic and can severely distort if you turn it up way .  The headphone is efficient though so not a concern in everyday listening.Efficiency is quite high which is good:Finally, group delay tells us something is amiss in the response that is causing that large peak in upper bass:Sony WH-1000XM4 Listening and EqualizationOne listen to the headphone off and you would want to put it down.  It is just so unpleasant as far as tonality.  I can't even describe it in words.  So let's not suffer too much and apply EQ to fix what ails it:You can see the large amount of correction I had to apply to it.  It took it though and it started to sound quite ""normal"" and pleasant.  I could listen to it for hours this way.As I noted earlier, I did not have level compensated measurements for when noise cancelling is on.  Fortunately as it is, the sound is fairly good.  Gone is the recessed and cluster phobic sound of when the unit is off.  As such my equalization is slight:As I noted in the measurement section though, distortion increases at higher levels so I would personally opt to use the passive with EQ when at the desk.Speaking of noise cancellation, I did a quick test of that (not set up yet for formal, objective tests).  As usual, these headphones rely on ""belts and suspenders"" principle by isolating noise passively as much as they can and then use noise cancellation.  I used my very noisy Audio Precision analyzer as stimulus.  Just wearing the headphone with it off, it got rid of 80% of the noise. What was left was naturally lower frequencies that are harder to filter.  Once I turned on NC, it zeroed that noise out like it never was there.   Note that the active mode had no effect on non-repetitive noise sources such as my wife working downstairs, doing dishes, etc.  ConclusionsThe Sony WH-1000MX4 is a highly flawed headphone in passive mode.  It would get one of the worst scores in my book in that mode.  It simply is not listenable.  Noise Cancellation thankfully improves on that so much that you could use it without further EQ.  Unfortunately you are then limited by the power ability of the internal headphone amp so know that it won't get ear bleeding loud.  Equalization cleaned up the response of passive mode substantially so if you have that available, then you are in good shape.Overall, I am going to recommend the Sony WH-1000MX4 if you apply equalization.  Without it, the active mode would barely get a nod from me as well.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was sent to me by @crinacle as he has been a consultant on the project. It costs US $50.I like that it has a bit of ""bling"" but not too much.  The cord is just the right length for me (many IEMs are too short for my use). It is super flexible with very little microphonics. You get two sets of silicone pads in three different sizes which suites me fine. I wear the largest one and it stays nicely put.The claim to fame of this IEM is that it complies with the Harman target.  Let's see if that is the case.EDIT: These are the included tips and the ones used for measurement and listening tests:Truthear Crinnacle Zero IEM MeasurementsLet's start with our frequency response measurement:I must say I was not prepared for such a tight fit to our target!  Other than a hair droop at 20 Hz and a bit deviation here and there, the response hugs our target a wet towel!  Very nice.  This renders our difference frequency response kind of useless:Distortion is good enough at lower levels but gets a bit much at maximum SPL:Group delay is not revealing for IEMs and such is the case here:Impedance shows evidence of some tuning in bass frequencies:The low impedance means many amps and sources can drive it but it is very low.   Sensitive is on the low side as well for an IEM:Truthear Crinnacle Zero IEM Listening TestsAs usual I start with my female vocals.  My first reference track had excellent warmth courtesy of proper low frequency response.  This continued from track to track with tonality that was just delightful.  It not only sounds ""right"" but also enjoyable.  The sound you get is like the best speaker in best room with no room modes.  Of course there is no tactile feedback so deep bass doesn't sound the same but you get the picture.I cranked up the volume on it and it kind of gets loud but I thought the bass started to gradually get distorted.  Not a practical problem as you are not going to want to listen at those unsafe volumes.I am sitting here typing this review and listening to it and marveling how nice every track sounds!ConclusionsWhat on earth are you doing reading the rest of this review? Go and buy one of these! I don't care if you don't listen to IEMs normally.  You want this IEM so you know what correct tonality is, when you listen with other transducers such as headphones and speakers.  Think of it as the tuning fork that a musician uses!  This IEM needs to be in your arsenal.For those of you who use IEMs as I do in summer months (headphones wear too hot), you are in for a treat for peanuts out of your pocket. The science works.  Kudos to @crinacle for advocating this execution.  We are indebted to you for your contribution here.I am happy to strongly recommend the Truthear Crinnacle Zero IEM.

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $79.For its price, this is an attractive look.  Alas, the cups are small cutting off the top of my ear.  They also wear quite hot.  Otherwise they are light and comfortable to wear.The small cups made measurements extremely challenging.  Smallest variations would cause huge change in channel matching and bass output.  So if you were glasses and or can't get a good seal, this is not a headphone for you.Status Audio CB-1 MeasurementsPer above, this is the best I could get with the target of matching levels as opposed to most bass output (although it is fairly optimized for that as well):Compliance is not great with our target and there are a lot of kinks in the response indicating resonances.  Correcting for them at micro level will be impossible but one can do better with coarser filters using the variations from our target:Distortion is kind of  manageable at 94 dBSPL sans the resonances that exist in lower treble:Group delay shows the same kinks we saw in frequency response:Impedance is flat and low:Combined with high sensitivity the CB-1 should be an easy headphone to drive:Status Audio CB-1 Listening Tests and EQAt first blush, the sound was not offensive but lacked what I call the ""hi-fi factor.""  So I started to add a few filters from the frequency response measurements:The difference was dramatic especially after you listened to the EQed version.  Going back felt like you had a 3-way speaker that had its woofer and tweeter turned off!  I was impressed by its handling of deep bass with no hint of distortion.  While response was very good, I continue to feel like the highs were a bit grungy.  Mind you, post EQ they were more open and detail was increased but I just couldn't bring myself to praise highs.  This may be due to me being biased by distortion measurements however.ConclusionsMeasurements show a flawed headphone implementation.  It is not clear what target they were going after (they claim reference grade for studio use). And what is there has a lot of glitches.  This is also reflected in distortions where our hearing is more sensitive. As usual though, equalization performs miracles taking a bland headphone experience to very high levels of fidelity and enjoyment.  Assuming the comfort is OK with you, then the EQed version does the job and pretty well.I can't recommend the Status Audio CB-1 due to rough and non-compliant response out of the box.  While EQ helps a ton, it doesn't do anything for me as far as comfort so can't recommend it even then.---------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $543 on Amazon including Prime shipping.Focal nails the luxury look and feel of their headphones:It is a heavy headphone at 420 grams but felt quite comfortable on my head:Drivers are angled so there is quite a lot of depth in the cup on that side (62 mm x 54 mm x 32 mm: height x width x depth).By far the worst aspect of this headphone is the super stiff and short cable that I received with it.  Yes, it is sturdy but if the idea is portable use, who wants to carry a stiff rod in their backpack or purse?  It is also microphonic.  Fortunately it terminates in mono 3.5 mm connectors so you can make or buy a replacement easily.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was good.Focal Elegia MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response:This is a very wavy response.  It is one thing to decide to have flat response in bass and midrange but why the ups and downs?  I am also not used to seeing the sharp drops so low in frequency.  Macro level picture is obvious with lack of bass to go with lack of lower treble:Is it me or every Focal headphone I have tested has a different response?Distortion measurements are good but not exceptional:Since we need to boost the bass, I expect audible issues there at elevated playback levels.Group delay says something is amiss at three frequencies that we had troughs in frequency response:Zoomed version of our impedance measurement tells the same story:Likely there is an out of phase resonance that causes cancellation at the upper two frequencies.This is a very sensitive headphone despite its low impedance:So you should be able to get good dynamics out of it even with low powered sources.  Keep this in mind however as you do any AB tests against much less sensitive headphones.  These may seem less dynamic without equalizing levels.Focal Elegia Listening TestsPer my past experience, lack of energy in a few areas translates to an uninteresting but non-offensive sound.  The lower treble energy made my female vocals much less enjoyable.  So I dialed in a few parametric filters in my Roon Player to compensate:The difference as expected was dramatic.  The sound opens up with very nice spatial effects.  Deep bass is now easily heard and even felt at elevated levels.  Alas, if you crank it up, the bass notes start to produce static.  It is soft tone though and doesn't ever fall apart like Focal Clear did in my review.  Turn the levels down a bit though and the deep bass is there without much of any distortion.EQ combined with the comfort this headphone provides, allowed for very enjoyable experience.ConclusionsThe wild west of headphone design continues with the Elegia presenting yet another frequency response.  I hope the industry starts to rally behind something -- anything is better than each headphone producing its own response gambling for some adoption.  Fortunately equalization is incredibly beneficial on this headphone, elevating not only its tonality but also its spatial qualities.I can't recommend the Focal Elegia without equalization.  With EQ, it becomes very good to superb if you don't turn it up too high and cause static in the drivers.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Mounting the headphone on my test fixture was challenging, resulting in quite a lot of variation between channels and overall response.  I optimized this as best as I could but like there are some error in low frequencies.Audio Technical ATH-M50X MeasurementsLet's start with frequency response of M50X and comparison to our preference target to figure out tonality of the headphone:Due to the dip around 425 Hz, I actually referenced this headphone to the response at 600 Hz (otherwise the whole curve would be above our target).  Once there, we see good agreement from 500 Hz to about 3000 Hz which is very good.  Sub-bass is nice too unlike many headphones I measure.  The hump centered around 150 Hz of course is a glaring fault as are a couple of peaks between 4 and 6 kHz.Subtracting one curve against the other we get:I liked the impressively low distortion from midrange up:After we pull down the hump around 150 Hz, distortion should improve even more there.Group delay shows some indication of why the response is so clean from 500 Hz and up:Impedance is dead flat and low so look for amplifiers that have good current capability:Sensitivity is very good:My RME ADI-2 DAC could drive the M50X to ear bleeding levels.Audio Technical ATH-M50X Headphone Listening Tests & EQWithout equalization the sound was fine.  Bass was exaggerated a bit depending on content. Spatial qualities were low with sound on each side of the ear.  You could live with it if you didn't have EQ.  I have EQ so I went to work on that.  Getting rid of the bloat in upper bass let more of the detail in music to be heard.  There was too little bass though so I put in the other two boost filters around it.  I found the treble a bit annoying so dialed in two small filters for the two peaks we saw in frequency response.At this point, the sound was quite good.  Power handling was superb with me not be able to find the limits of the headphone as noted earlier.   You can put an early end to your hearing without the headphone complaining with heavy distortion.Note: I did not spend too much time fully tuning the filters.  I got the results I wanted so I stopped there.  Due to large difference between the two cups, more optimization may result in slightly better response.ConclusionsThere is no feeling of fanciness here which goes with the cost of the unit.  Performance without equalization benefits from lots of good bass but that can be too much of a good thing.  Equalization took the headphone from just ""OK"" to ""yeh, this is sounding really good!"" I am only going to recommend the Audio Technical ATH-M50X with equalization.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased new by a member and sent to me for testing.  It costs US $990.The Celestee has a luxury feel to it that fits the price:I am not fond of the spring action though.  The headband spring pressure is extremely progressive, putting up a huge fight if you try to expand them after a bit of expansion.  On my head they fit but were rather tight.  On the positive side this provided excellent sound isolation.Two 3.5 mm plugs terminate in the headphone cups.  They are stiff enough that should not pull out.  The supplied cord likewise terminates in 3.5 mm plug.  It is quite short, probably 3 to 4 feet.  It seems to be designed for portable use as I definitely want it longer for desktop use.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture.

In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Mounting the headphone on my test fixture was somewhat challenging.   I try to match the levels but it was very hard in low frequencies.  As you see in a bit, that had nothing to do with the mounting.Focal Celestee MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our stereo frequency response measurements:I was pleased with the tight matching of the low frequency response to our target curve (dashed blue).  What I did not like was the droop in the green channel below 80 Hz.  I tried to compensate by moving the headphone around but no matter what I did, that large discrepancy remained.  Looking at a few other measurements in the field, they also show a mild version of this ""kink.""  It is very surprising to see such mismatching from a company like Focal with its extensive driver manufacturing capabilities. Response is more or less good until we get past 3 kHz where we have a 2 kHz valley.  There is a large peak around 13 kHz but that is likely not audible by itself.Relative frequency response shows the dip more clearly:Distortion was very low:Same in absolute level:Note that bass distortion looks worse than it is since we have good response there (so the previous graph is more representative).  Really, it is all very good news on distortion front.Impedance is somewhat variable:Given its low value, it is current hungry although that term barely applies given the high efficiency of Celestee:Group delay shows well behaved response more or less:Ideal curve would exponentially roll off but we have a dip around 60 Hz.  That is where the kink is in the one channel so maybe it is related.Focal Celestee Headphone Listening TestsWithout any equalization, the sound was non-offensive and boring.  The highs are muted and soundstage is mostly whacked in the middle of your head.  It takes a track with a lot of channel separation to push anything close to your ears as far as separation.  Some EQ helped things a lot:The addition of 5 dB to compensate for the large dip there helped a lot to open the sound and give it some much needed ""zing.""  Pulling the other two peaks down helped with a bit of upper bass boominiess.Something was strange though.  None of my sub-bass heavy soundtracks played such using Celestee.  It was not until I was getting ready to write this review that this must have been due to major shortfall in the one channel.  I don't have the ability to just EQ one channel but using that, maybe you can fix that.  With EQ, the sound was fine but still nothing to get excited about.  Comparing to Dan Clark RT AEON Closed, the latter was more somewhat more open sounding (both without EQ).  With EQ, the AKG K371 blew the Celestee out of the water with deep thundering sub-bass and excellent separation of instrumentation and sense of detail. I was going to give the Celestee one grade higher until this comparison.  I also found the K371 more comfortable to wear due to its much lighter weight.ConclusionsThis was a tough review to write and originally was supposed to come out yesterday.  But I waited a bit and had my son test it as well.  I thought based on measurements that the sound would be more pleasing than it was.  Neither, he, nor I thought much of the tonality without EQ.  With EQ, you can rescue it but it is still nothing to rave behind.  At least I couldn't.  Most of the time the problems with headphones are more obvious than here.  So this conclusion is not without some reservations.As is, given the high cost, I can't recommend the Focal Celestee.  If you spend this kind of money, you want the headphone to put a smile on your face.  The Celestee simply does not do that to me.  I really don't know what their target for tonality was with this headphone.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $700 on Amazon including Prime shipping (retail $999).This is one massive headphone!As you see, it dwarfs the panther next to it.  For both testing and listening tests I had it in its lowest setting.  It fit me but if you have less tall head, then it may not on you.  Good news is that the Ananda is extremely light for its size, coming at 410 grams.  As you see, the cup is oval so while the height is 88mm, I can't give you an exact width of the inside of the cup.  I measured it more or less at 57mm.  Depth to the dust cover is 17 mm.Comfort was excellent despite the large size.  I quickly forgot about them after a few minutes.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Mounting the headphone on the text fixture was easy requiring almost no manipulation to get proper measurements.  However, I noticed a gap on both cups facing forward.  There is a depression there.  Pushing the cups closer to the side of the rig pushed up the level of the bass resonance you see below but kept the bass roll off essentially the same.  So I did not deem it significant.Hifiman Andanda MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our stereo frequency response measurements:Staying at high level first, we see the aforementioned sudden drop in sub-bass starting at 40 Hz and going down.  Otherwise we have more or less our preference curve until we get to 1 kHz where we see the all too common shortfall.  This continues to 3 kHz then we are OK until we notice the peaks exceeding our preference curve starting at 8 kHz or so.At more focused level there are a ton of variations and kinks in the response.  It seems the headphone/driver are going through many distortion mechanisms due to resonances, reflections and general driver issues.  We can see the chaotic aspect in group delay graph:I think this is the worst I have seen it here.  Speaking of distortion, we have a lot of it was well:Sure, at lower levels it is not extreme but still, this is not competitive as high-end headphones go.  These distortion mechanisms needed to have been found and resolved.  Here is the same in absolute at lowest measured level of 94 dBSPL:I like to see a clear gap above a few hundred hertz and peak distortion and we don't have it here.  Around 7 kHz we actually exceed our target fair bit.Back to frequency response, here is our deviation from target:Impedance is flat as is typical in planar magnetic headphones since we basically have traces of wire:You are in luck as you can use my 33 ohm headphone amp measurements and directly figure out how loud these play.  And loud they do given the good sensitivity:Hifiman Ananda Headphone Listening TestsBefore talking about music listening, let me comment on how loud and piercing the frequency response sweeps were.  I almost felt like hearing protection!  Not only these thing spit out the sound but do so at elevated levels in highs.  So best to not wear them around other people.Overall experience with music as far as tonality was ""eh.""    There is little sub-bass to make me happy and a bit of brightness because or independent of it.  You do get nice sensation of ""speakers away from your ear"" though which is very pleasing.  It nicely pushes the sound out some and leaves room for instruments to image between it and the ear. All of this was not enough to get me to ignore the tonality problems though so the parametric equalization tool came out:Yes, there is a ton in there.  I first pulled up the deficiency in 1 to 3 kHz which as I would have predicted, jazzed up the spatial qualities of this headphone even more.  Sound was bright and at first I tried a shelving filter for highs.  That didn't do the trick as well as two parametric filters to pull down those peaks in the frequency response.  We were close but not quite there.  Boosting the sub-bass region first with one shelving filter and then two did the trick to give balance to overall tonality and shave off the remaining brightness.The sound was good now but still I felt some bass was missing so dialed in the 1.5 dB broad boost centered around 90 Hz.  That warmed things up a bit more which was nice.  I still had some grunginess I did not like so put in the dip 930 Hz and that helped.Once there, the transformation was dramatic.  The headphone tonality was very nice now and sound super open and pleasing.  Alas, after a few minutes of listening, I lost interest in wearing these headphones and focused once more on some grunginess.  Mind you, it could just be imagined problem but the final outcome was unlike other headphones that I listen to that are nice.  I usually won't stop until I have to do the review.  Didn't happen here.ConclusionsThe focus with Hifiman Ananda seems to be ""big is good.""  I agree with that especially when combined with low weight.  There is something really nice about wearing two 6 inch speakers suspended on each side of your ear.  Alas, many compromises were made in execution of this headphone causing roughness in frequency response in addition to macro tonality issues.  Fortunately correcting the tonality also helped with distortion factors but in my opinion, not fully.If you have this headphone, then I suggest trying the EQ as I have proposed and tune to it taste.  The result should be quite satisfying and unique.  If you don't have it, I can't recommend that you buy the Hifiman Ananda.  It just has too many flaws which I feel the company could have dealt with prior to releasing it.Edit: video review is now online:------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Being an on ear headphone, mounting this on the fixture's artificial ear is a challenge.  Exactly where do you position this on the ear?  I made a guess, performed a set of measurements.  Then I listened.  It sounded  nothing like the measurements!  During listening tests I realized that there is a sweet spot for tonality and bass as you shift the headphones forward and back on your ear.  So I went back to the fixtured and optimized it the same way. This time objective and subjective correlation was much better but still, be on guard that what you see is approximate.  And that you may wear them differently than I did for both measurements/listening tests.Yamaha RH-5Ma ohm MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements: Step back and take off your glasses if you are wearing them and you see that the overall compliance to our preference curve is actually pretty good.  Between 60 Hz and 4 kHz, we are very close considering the accuracy of measurements.  Past that all the peaks exceed our curve so likely the sound is accentuated in the highs.  Bass is good and only sub-bass may need a boost:We have somewhat problematic distortion in the middle of the important audible band:Fortunately we need to pull down the response some in that region so maybe we can improve on this.Group delay is not very revealing other than pointing out the kink in response around 410 Hz is real:Impedance is flat and low:Sensitivity is high though so you should be able to use just about anything to drive these headphones:Yamaha RH-5Ma Listening Tests and EqualizationAs I noted in the preface, my first impression of this headphone was, ""hey, these sound correct!""  Yes, there was a hint of brightness but otherwise, I didn't even feel like applying equalization to them.  Still, I thought I fix a few things in the response and this is what I got:The sound now is delightful!  I don't know how it manages it but there are also spatial qualities.  There is plenty of bass response and dynamic range is excellent.  I am able to almost vibrate my ear lobes at max volume for the second or two I pushed it there!  ConclusionsHere I go again, misjudging a headphone by just looking at it.  I read that it was a ""studio headphone"" and chuckled thinking I will find a ton of response problem.  Not so.  Compliance is very good despite our challenges in measuring this class of headphones.  If you can tolerate a bit of brightness, it works fine out of the box.  With equalization, the sound goes to the next level, definitely satisfying your audiophile desires.  I am going to recommend the Yamaha RH-5Ma.  It is much better than it looks especially with equalization.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is mechanically very microphonic as it brushes against your body and does not way to lay softly anywhere.This is heavy headphone:But the design is so comfortable you would not know it when wearing it.The pads are oval and drivers are mounted at an angle.

If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was miserable.  Slightest movement would make a huge change in bass and more so in one channel than the other.  What you are about to see below is the best I could get it.Focal Stellia MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response:We have decent compliance from about 60 Hz to 3 kHz which means it should sound OK without equalization.  We see some early in the response dips around 3 to 4 kHz which should not be there.Relative frequency response for equalization purposes is thus:I was disappointed to see this level of distortion in such a high-end and expensive headphone:I expect the 94 dB line to hug the floor above deep bass but here, it wiggles around.  And gets worse with higher amplification.Group delay is decently clean other than the same 3.2 kHz anomaly we saw in frequency response:Wonder if this is a reflection from back of the cup.  Fortunately it is better than the Focal Elegia I reviewed which had to such cancellations.Impedance is the same as Elegia:Sensitivity is excellent:Be very careful as you compare this headphone to others that may be much less sensitive.  It will play much louder making you think it sounds better, it is more dynamic, etc. where it might not be.Focal Stellia Listening Tests and EqualizationMeasurements completely predict the sound of this headphone: it sounds ""OK"" out of the box.  A bit heavy sounding due to boosted upper bass.  It lacks spatial qualities due to lack of energy in lower treble.  Deep bass response is decent though.  All can be improved substantially with a bit of equalization:This combination sounded a tad bright but with that came very nice spatial qualities.  It goes from almost having none to B+/A- level.I performed AB testing against my Dan Clark Stealth headphone without equalizing the Stellia.  It was no match.  Stealth had correct tonality with better bass and much better spatial qualities.  With EQ, Stellia become far more competitive, maybe slightly pulling ahead Stealth in spatial qualities.  Tonality was a bit brighter which may have aided that.  Note that matching levels was critical for this.  With a comfortable level for Stellia, Stealth makes almost no sound!    I am exaggerating but the sensitivity difference is massive.ConclusionsFocal had two jobs here:1. Optimize styling.  They get A+ here.  Even the case and packaging oozes luxury and greatness and would be at home at a Prada store.2. Optimize technical performance.  This is basically an objective failure.  There is not one thing you can hang your hat on that they have done right.  Distortion is high.  Frequency response doesn't comply with anything known and is yet again different from the rest of their headphones.  Simple measurements like impedance indicate resonances and problems in the design.  Company talks about ""pure copper"" wire uses to make the driver.  Who the heck cares if you can't get a linear driver and produces proper response without so much distortion???  Very disappointing.Thankfully equalization rescues it and brings out benefit of such things as angled drivers to produces enjoyable sound.  But come on Focal.  Please start with a clean sheet of paper and pay as much attention to electroacoustic design that you put in styling.  I don't have a mirror in front of me and can't see what the headphone looks like when I am using it.  I hear the sound so please focus on that.  Forget whatever random ideas that are behind each headphone. Get behind one response curve and minimize distortion.  I am confident you can do it.I can't recommend the Focal Stellia without EQ.  With EQ, it is very nice and salvages this headphone nicely.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It moves in an out with a feeling of smoothness that is hard to describe, but easy to appreciate.  Put them on your head and they just melt over you.

E-MU Teak MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements: There are fair number of irregularities in the response but if you look past them, there is broad agreement with our preference curve in dashed blue.  So overall tonality should be good sans the extra energy above 5 kHz which can make it sound bright.  Relative graph for eq purposes shows the same:I really like the extended bass response which we rarely see in headphones despite research indicating the listener desire and preference.Distortion is typical in the way it rises in low  frequencies:Since we don't have to add much equalization for bass, I am not too worried about that.  There is some peaking around 2.2 kHz which I wish was not there.  Fortunately at lower SPL levels it barely registers.Group delay shows the effect of some of those kinks in the response as likely being some secondary resonance or reflection:Impedance is low and mostly flat:Sensitivity is well above average which should make it easy to drive:E-MU Teak Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationAt first blush, the overall tonality sounds right and combined with some spatial effects, you think you are there already.  But after listening a bit more, I started to notice the extra brightness.  So I brought out the EQ to see if the measurements back that or not:I took a couple of peaks down as you see.  The effect is subtle due to narrow correction.  That lost a bit of spatial effects but I more than made up for it with the 3300 Hz increase.  Indeed, there now was more than delightful amount of that.  A bit of sub-pass boost and now you have a gorgeous sounding headphone!  Very nice.ConclusionsThe E-MU Teak is beautiful to look at and hold.  Objective performance out of box is near that as well.  Add some EQ though and you wind up with a super nice sounding headphone with good spatial effects and superb dynamics and bass.  It put a smile on my face on track after track that I played.I am going to put the E-MU Teak on my recommendation list.  With equalization, I am going to strongly recommend it.Note: I read elsewhere that if you live in a dry place, the wooden cups can shrink so much that they can detach!  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitting these headphones on the fixture was super easy with matching of the two cups and levels at two different frequencies.As is my usual practice, I look around for other reviews and measurements before finalizing mine.  It was very difficult to find measurements of the SE version.  Claim on the internet is that only the color is different.  I saw no proof of this with measurements of both side by side.  As you see below, my measurements markedly differ from 598 series posted online.  I have no explanation for the discrepancy but stand beyond mine being correct for this sample.Sennheiser HD598 SE* MeasurementsAs usual we start with our frequency response:I line up my measurements around 425 Hz.  Here you could shift that point and get slightly different visual representation but the story will be the same: there is a massive bass to mid-range boost from 70 Hz up to 500 Hz.  This part correlates with measurements of 598 in the wild (although maybe not peaking as much).  I then show a huge shortfall between 500 and 3000 Hz.  This would indeed be a horribly sounding headphone if correct:Distortion is high in upper bass and at elevated volume but fortunately we have excess output there so EQ will be in our favor:Mid to high frequency distortion is extremely low:Group delay indicates issues in sub-bass which may just be due to very low output in that region:This is sensitive headphone that is easy to drive:Impedance is middle of the road so you don't need a ton of voltage to drive it:Sennheiser HD 598 SE Listening Tests and EqualizationIt took playing just a few seconds of my first standard test clip to realize this is one horrible sounding headphone!  Boomy bass swamps the mid-frequency detail and was distorted to boot (at higher volumes).  There was zero spatial qualities which is indicative of hole in response between 1 and 5 kHz which measurements tell us we have.Fortunately the shortfalls are broad in nature so was quick to bring them into compliance with just four filters:The transformation was incredible.  Sub-bass was now clean and powerful, able to play as loud as you ever wanted.  I could literally get my ear lobes to resonate and tingle for the second or two I pushed it!  What a great sensation if hearing loss was not to follow after extended listening.  The sound become very open with female vocals and sharper instruments coming to the forefront with zero harshness.  Spatial qualities went from grade F to B+.  Combined with the comfort of the headphone, I could and did listen for a long time.As a confirmation, I had my oldest adult son do an AB test with and without EQ.  He thought on some tracks the difference was subtle but on others, he liked that it took away the boominess and made the instruments so separate.  Note that I had not shown him any measurements or what the EQ was doing.ConclusionsThe measurements and subjective results by no less than three humans agree that out of box tuning of this headphone is horrible.  This doesn't jive with any review I read on the 598 or 598 SE.  I tend to think that there is more to this SE version than just color back.  Anyway, I am not going to generalize the response to all 598 SEs.  The walk-away point though is that objective measurements proved their worth strongly in confirming subjective listening tests and showing the path to equalization. For this specific Sennheiser HD598SE, I cannot recommend it without EQ.  It simply is horrid.  With EQ however, it becomes a keeper. I understand you can pick these up used for $100 or so at times.  If so, and they all measure/EQ like this, they would be a good choic.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly donated to me by a member and costed US $200 (discontinued).This is not a bad looking headphone.  Alas, the cups are a bit small for my ears so not very comfortable for me to wear.  Let's see how it measures on our GRAS 45CA fixture.  I should note that there was fair amount of variability with the slightest change in the alignment.audio-technica ATH-MSR7 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our headphone frequency response measurements and comparison to target response:Seems like a rather unique response with that dip around 4 kHz and various ups and downs.  If stepping back though, it seems to be reasonably compliant from 50 to 2 kHz.  There is pronounced peaking in treble region.Here is the relative response (to our target) for development of EQ:Distortion is very low at lower volumes with the minor exception of a resonance around 5.1 kHz:Group delay is not very revealing but does show a blip at the same resonance:Impedance is low and flat:Combined with high sensitivity, it should be usable on many source devices:audio-technica ATH-MSR7 Headphone Listening Tests and EQFirst impression was a dull sound which is due to combination of the dip in lower treble and boosted upper bass.  So I developed a set of filters to correct:Once there, the sound was open, less boomy while at the same time having impressive sub-bass.  I enjoyed listening to the headphones stepping through my reference tracks.  The clarity was there was was dynamics.ConclusionsFollowing the typical wild west of headphone tonality, the ATH-MSR7 presents a number of variations from our target.  Half a dozen filters mostly cures that and when combined with low distortion, creates a very nice hi-fi experience.  The cups are small for people like me with larger ears.    So be sure you can return it if it doesn't fit you well.I am only going to recommend the audio-technica ATH-MSR7 with equalization.

I purchased this headphone last year due to reputation of getting some of the highest scores relative to Harman preference curve.  It costs US $89 on Amazon including Prime shipping.I like the look and feel of the MDR-7506:The headphone itself is very light and compact.  Alas the coiled cord is rather heavy and has a habit of falling to the floor because of it.While this headphone is new to me, its original -- the MDR-V6 is not.  When I was visiting the major music labels back in early 2000s, the MDR-V6 was one of the top three or so respected headphones (Sennheiser and Stax being the other two).  So I purchased a V6 but hardly used it and unfortunately have little memory of it.  I thin I gave it to one of my sons years ago.I was surprised how uncomfortable the MDR-7506 is.  It would pinch the outer areas of my ears to a point where I could not wear then for more than a few minutes.  I realized then that taking my glasses off helped but I still could not tolerate them for than 15 to 20 minutes.  There is a lot of headband pressure and due to the small cups, it lands on the other part of ear.  Strangely, I don't remember this about the MDR-V6?  Is it possible my ears have grown in ensuing years and no longer fit inside these cups?  The thought is too scary to consider!  Sony MDR-7506 MeasurementsLet's get right into it with the MDR-7506 frequency response and comparison to our target preference:As you can see, there is good bit of variation between the two cups.  Being a small headphone, I had a lot more trouble getting consistent fit between the two channels.  Still, I think the results are pretty correct as they correlate quite well with other measurements.  The one area of deviation is that peak around 11 kHz.  Other measurements including that of Harman's show that shooting way up.  The older couplers tended to exaggerate the response in that region which my new GRAS 45C coupler avoid.  Still, hard to know what the truth is there.Back to the measurements and just looking at the green calibrated channel, we see excellent agreement with our target curve (dashed blue) from about 100 Hz to 2 kHz.  Past that we overshoot the curve and stay above up to 8 kHz or so.  This naturally will make the headphone sound bright and potentially with wider soundstage. Bass department has the usual droop but much less than some others. Overall one can see how this headphone that can higher agreement with Harman preference curve than many other.  You can see this clearly in the deviation from our target:Notice the broad area at or around 0 dB deviation. So far there was good news.  What wasn't good news is what followed, namely distortion measurements:Oh wow!  This headphone has more distortion at 94 dB than many do at 114 dB in bass!  We are also usually spoiled by headphones having very little distortion above 1 kHz or so.  Not here.  We have distortion where our hearing is sensitive as well.  Distortion in bass was so high that it overshot the graph so I changes scales:Nearly 20% distortion at around 55 Hz at 114 dB.  Here is another view of the 94 dBSPL and its breakdown:This will be a good test of how important distortion is relative to frequency response -- a battle we constantly have here and in context of speakers.Group delay is rather calm as this graph goes:We don't see the large spikes in high frequencies.  Maybe smaller cups create less of these against the body of the measurement fixture?Impedance is variable so take care in using any amplifier that has high impedance:Sensitivity is very good so you don't need much power to drive them.Sony MDR-7506 Listening TestsI remember being quite disappointed when I listened to the MDR-7506 last year when I purchased it.  I neither liked the sound, nor the comfort.  It quickly sat on my desk collecting dust.  With much more careful testing now I can tell why.   You all know that I am a fan of sub-bass performance and evaluating such at higher levels.  Not so here.  I initially boosted the sub-bass and it became ugly.  It became boomy (harmonics travel to upper bass and cause that) with the notes not being clean and sharp at all.Then there were the highs.  Oh man these are ugly highs.  Sharp and uncomfortable.  Yes, the mid-range tonality was good but I just could not focus on it.  Every bass note sounded ugly, and every high note was a punch in the face.  Overall there was this poor quality and grittiness I could not get past.Took out the EQ tool and made some improvements:As I said, I boosted the lows but immediately took that out and focused on the peaking between 2 and 8 kHz.  That resulted in the two filters that you see.  That provided good relief from the sharp highs but I still did not like the sound.  Per above, it just didn't sound clean to me.  Remembering a trick from my speaker optimizations, I actually filtered out some of the sub-bass and that made a nice improvement in clarity and fidelity.  Ironically, even though I was cutting out the lows, the overall tonality is much warmer with better bass than no EQ at all because the highs were taken down.Usually once I EQ a speaker or headphone, I get much better sound and am happy with it.  Not here.  Taking down the highs collapsed the little soundstage that was there, leaving me with a dull, middle of the head image.  I am extremely sensitive to the harshness of the highs so this was the proper compromise for me but even I could not tolerate the boring spatial effect.The loss of deep bass was a miss too.  I could no longer enjoy any of my tracks with such content.Mind you, on some tracks I thought the fidelity was better than many speakers but in the context of all music played and comparing to other headphones, the results was simply not competitive.ConclusionsBoy, talking about getting myself in a pickle giving such low scores subjectively to a headphone that has done so well in research.  There are two possibilities:1. Something is wrong with me and my hearing and I would not feel this way in controlled testing.2. I am far more bothered by the listeners in research by a) too much energy in treble region and b) distortion.  A related factor to this is content used for testing.  Without the right content a lot of the issues I found would not be audible or as bothersome.Then there is the issue of comfort.  I see there are a lot of aftermarket pads for these so maybe that can be solved.  But then the cost goes up.Overall I can't see a good reason to recommend the Sony MDR-7506.  It gets some important things right (mid-range tonality) but so many things wrong that I just can't tell anyone to go and get one.  If you have it, please give the above EQ a test and report what you think.So there, we have another massively popular headphone covered so that we have a reference for other headphone reviews to come.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased and donated to the forum for review. It costs US $50.This is an ultra light headphone that folds into a very small package:You barely feel it on your ear and that is it.  It is extremely comfortable for me.I have fond memories of this headphone wearing on long flights to Japan when I was working for Sony in early 1990s.  I remember it having a surprisingly warm sound for such a diminutive headphone.  Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The cups fit my fixture's artificial ears easily although it is hard to know if they emulate how they would land on yours.KOSS Porta Pro MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:We see why I thought they had a warm sound due to excess energy between 70 and 400 Hz.  Above that we have good compliance but then have two major troughs.  Sub-bass is missing in action as one would predict.  Subtracting the measurement from our target we get the relative response which I use to develop eq filters:Drivers can't seem to handle bass well and have some acoustic anomaly around 4 kHz:Impedance is variable and on the low side:They sip power though so you should be able to drive them with most sources:Group delay identifies messiness around 4 kHz due to reflections:Koss Porta Pro Listening Tests and EqualizationThe impression of upper bass comes across immediately with these headphones.  It sounds a bit stuffy due to that, and lack of energy further down the frequency range.  It is not too bad but clearly not what we want out of a high-fidelity headphone.  A few filters perform miracles here:The sound was now more open and better balanced.  I was especially impressed with some amount of spatial qualities which I did not expect to come from these small headphones.  Combine with the comfort they provide, this becomes a very enjoyable headphone to listen to.ConclusionsThe Porta Pro is as classic as you can get.  It is good to see that it doesn't produce crazy wrong response.  It does need equalization which once deployed, produces a very nice experience.  It is so good that after I took the review picture, I put them back on to listen to as I am typing this!  It is a nice alternative to IEMs for those hot summer days to wear.Without EQ, the KOSS Porta Pro doesn't get a recommendation from me.  But add EQ, and it becomes recommended with a smile.  "
35,7136a5c2-b889-4d03-8abb-3e43e4505ea1,On-Ear,Sony,MDR-ZX110,105.0,1/18/21,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/9-headphone-review-sony-mdr-zx110.19484/,30.0,"This is a review of Sony MDRZX110 to figure out if a US $9.99 headphone on Amazon including Prime shipping has good performance.  There are over 45,000 reviews on Amazon averaging 4.5 stars saying it has that.  But let's find out!I must say, as cheaply as the Sony is made, it doesn't look like kids toys as some do in this price range:The pad kind of feels luxurious if you lower your standard somewhat:Due to very low eight (about 4 ounces) and rather soft  pads, I found the MDR-ZX110 quite comfortable to wear.  After just a few minutes you forget about it.  It is certainly more comfortable than much larger headphones.   There is a bit of sound isolation which was enough to get rid some of the high-pitch whine from my PC's fan.  This obviously will different depending on your ears.Naturally this is an on-ear headphone which should make it ""fun"" to measure.Note 1: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result.  In addition, comparison of measurements between different people doing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill.  So don't look for matching results.  Focus on high level picture.Note 2: I worked for Sony back in 1990s for good number of years.  So while I like to see them do well in these reviews, I have no attachment to the company or its products.Sony MDR-ZX110 MeasurementsThe flexible artificial ear on my Gras fixture was a big help in getting something close to how a human would wear it, compressing under the load.  Even with that help, I was getting measurements of each cup that was 4 to 5 dB different from each other and skewed in time (different path length to the microphone).  I played around for a good while and right before giving up, I landed on one placement where both channels locked on top of each other.  Figuring this was a good omen, I ran with it:Due to fitment issues, I would not trust the order magnitude of shortfall in lower bass frequencies but for sure, there is insufficient energy there.  Actually, there is insufficient energy in multiple areas.  This may be the reason behind the success of this headphone: by not having too much energy in lower and upper treble, it is NOT going to sound bright.  Then again it will sound dull because a lot of the sparkle, soundstage, etc. comes from those regions.  We see the shortfalls if you subtract the response from our target preference curve:Distortion graph looks simultaneously excellent and horrible depending on which part of the frequency range you look at:I don't know how much to trust the low frequency distortions but above 500 Hz, the response is actually excellent at 94 dBSPL and even 104 dBSPL, beating even state of the art speakers in this regard!   Compare this to our recently reviewed, $3000 Abyss Diana V2:See how much more distortion Diana V2 has in mid frequencies where our hearing is most sensitive?  This $9 headphone runs circles around it there.Let's look at the distortion using absolute level (rather than percentage above):Other than a blip or two, the MDR-ZX110 easily beats our 40 dB threshold for distortion.Group delay is more or less clean which somewhat explains why distortion is so low in mid to high frequencies:sensitivity is on the high side:However, the impedance is low which means you need a headphone amplifier that does well in my 33 ohm measurements:This is probably easier had on portable devices than headphones needing voltage.Sony MDR-ZX110 Headphone Listening Tests and OptimizationMy quick listen resulted in impression of somewhat muffled sound and slight over-presence of upper bass.  Both of these are reflected in the frequency response.  The main area of output is in 100 to 400 Hz so that dominates.  Result is inoffensive sound but we can do so much better with EQ:I went conservative with sub-bass enhancement as even with this amount, any track with that kind of content produced distorted notes.  Without it, the distortion was not very audible but then again the notes where not that present either.  In vast amount of music however, this bass enhancement was needed to balance the overall spectrum and benefits far outweighed the negatives.The three other peaking filters were as the frequency response instructed (eyeballed by me and optimized by ear). I must say, I was not prepared for the transformation that these four filters made.  The result was an extremely accurate and audiophile headphone!  If I performed a blind test, I am pretty sure many people would think this is a high-end headphone.  It certainly beats out majority of speakers out there.  I was most impressed with detail, clarity and spatial effects.  The latter was also a surprise.  Maybe the drivers sit an angle and provide for better results there.  While you don't have a huge soundstage, the instrument separation is quite good and satisfying.This thing sounded so good and was so comfortable that I kept listening to it last night and still doing it this morning!  Here are a couple of example tracks that make your jaw drop with this headphone and EQ:   Mercedes Sosa - Misa Criolla  (track: Kyrie)Mercedes' voice soars in this album.  After a slow start the choir and instruments kick in and the result is a fantastic experience making you forget you are listening to a dirt cheap headphone.  Even the deep bass is reproduced excellently at around 3:20.  FYI the real track sounds better than this youtube version.Deen Peer's Mars track sounds good on just about any system but there, I love the balance and clarity:ConclusionsWhen I picked up this headphone randomly to test last night, I did not have high hopes for it at all.  Cheap price and cheap feeling headphone.  Can't be a good combination.  Without equalization, it may be better than other junk headphones but otherwise, nothing I would use or recommend.  But EQ this headphone and it produces reference quality sound!  Yes, I know there will be riots in streets over this statement.  But try it: it costs the same as a fast food meal.What's that? You don't use EQ?  Well, I don't want to hear.  Actually, I don't even want to know you! You are wasting away your audiophile life without it.  For zero cost you can transform a $9 headphone to a reference quality reproduction engine and you still don't want to go there?  If so, I have nothing for you! If you are not into headphones but want to know what the fuss is about for no money, buy this $9 headphone and put in my EQ.  If you don't fall off your chair with excitement and get your pants wet with drool, I will come over and cancel out your audiophile credentials myself!Needless to say, I highly recommend the Sony MDR-ZX110 headphone.  Without EQ, it is acceptable but nothing I would rave about.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

The pads are so soft that slightest touch deforms them.  While this is good for initial comfort, not sure how long they will last before becoming totally compressed.  There were also some fine scratches on the cups.An unusual feature of this headphone is a switch on each cup which is supposed to adjust bass.  See my measurements later on effectiveness of it.These headphones are quite light:Cup size is reasonable at 67x46x18 (height, width, depth).Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was easy the first time.  On second try it was quite variable in bass due to the ultra soft pads. Takstar Pro 82 MeasurementsLet's start with the effect of the three-way bass switch:As you see, bass is increased but a dip is created around 350 Hz.  At first I tried to EQ the lowest setting for bass and while that got me best compliance with the target, I just could not make it sound good.  I tried the highest level and that didn't work either.  So I settled for the middle setting:Bad news here is distortion especially around 5 kHz where we have a dip in the frequency response as well:Group delay doesn't show much:Sensitivity is above average:Impedance is quite low:Still, you should be able to play this with many portable devices and get reasonable volume.Takstar Pro 82 Listening Tests and EqualizationWith the switch at its lowest setting tonality was decent.  But attempts at equalization just made the mid to high frequencies sound grungy and not desirable.  As I noted, I went back to the switch being in the middle.  That did better but at the end, I am not really happy with the performance:\There are no spatial qualities and I just didn't enjoy listening to these headphones.ConclusionsI spent three times more effort on this headphone than any other I test.  At the end it left me frustrated.  I am usually able to make just about every headphone sound good with EQ.  This one is one of the few that defeated me. The common thread appears to be distortion in the 3 to 5 kHz range.I can't recommend the Takstar Pro 82 for reasons mentioned.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.Getting a good fit was was challenging with a lot of variability.  I did my best but it may not be fully representative of what you or someone else may get.Tascam TH-07 MeasurementsThere is nothing more important than frequency response of a headphone as each is seemingly different and that difference leaves a very distinct character:As you all know, I like to see good amount of bass to comply with our preference curve but here, we are overshooting by good bit up to 300 Hz.  We then have decent matching and then some overshoot in treble region.Shockingly, the company publishes frequency response measurements although there is no indication of what fixture they were using.  Correlation is good with my measurements if I filter mine and change its aspect ratio to be closer to theirs:Relative frequency response is such:I was very disappointed to see high levels of distortion in upper mid-range/lower treble region:The bass we will deal with since we have to EQ that down but the upper region may be tough.  Here it is in absolute terms:Group delay shows some issues in the bass region as indicated by the dip in frequency response as well:Impedance is flat and low at 37 ohm:Sensitivity is better than average:So shouldn't be a hard headphone to drive.Tascam TH-07 Listening Tests and EqualizationWithout EQ, this is just not my cup of tea.  It sounds uninteresting and bass focused.  Equalization made a large difference:I had a serious high frequency resonances (female ""s"")  in one track that required good bit of attenuation in band 3 to tame it.  Without it, the track was unlistenable. While often equalization makes a dog of a headphone sound extremely good, such was not the case.  Improvement was very significant but did not elevate the sound enough for me to want to keep using the headphone.ConclusionsThe Tascam TH-07 objectively and subjectively misses the mark.  Granted, at $75 they are not exactly putting in a lot of engineering into this thing but still, I hold every audio product to a minimum standard and TH-07 does not get there.  If you own it, please use equalization as otherwise you are getting very lousy fidelity.I cannot recommend the Tascam TH-07 headphone.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It feels plasticky to be sure but other than foam rotting, they hold up well.They are pretty light:They pinch the top of ear though so I could not wear them for more than a few minutes.  Strange as I don't remember this when I wore them three decades back.  Wonder if we develop more pain receptors in our ears as we get older!

If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture worked on first try which surprised the heck out of me given the fact that these are on ear headphones.  But please heed the above warnings regarding accuracy of measurements especially in higher frequencies.Grado SR60x MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response:Now that is a simple story: very little bass (expected) and large bump in lower treble (not expected).  I can see this accentuating spatial qualities and detail and hence selling to folks.  Here is the relative curve for equalization:Gross equalization should be easy.Distortion is very high:As note though, we get luck with the peak around 4 kHz as we would be pulling that peak down a lot anyway.Impedance is on the low to medium side:Zooming in, we see the sins of the headphone:We see the same two peaks in frequency response indicating resonances in the headphone/driver.Group delay is messy in the same region:Edit: here is the updated sensitivity:Note that I measure sensitivity at 425 Hz.  With the large peaks in 2 to 4 kHz, it is likely to sound louder than this graph indicates.Grado SR60e Listening Tests and EqualizationI was listening to my every day Dan Clark Stealth when I switched over to Grado mid-song.  Immediate impression was oh, there are more highs here.  But not in a super obnoxious way if the peaking was at higher frequencies.  A bit more listening though and the sharpness starts to get to you so equalization is mandatory:The improvement with the two notch filters was dramatic.  It took the edge off the sound but still left enough for it to have good spatial qualities.  Bass boost was tricky as it is definitely needed but crank up the volume and the drivers start to generate static/crackle.  Fortunately it gradually comes over and for average listening you can push it that much.With all of this in place, I enjoyed listening to the SR60x.  Yes, the highs were still a bit artificial and edgy if I can call them that.  But there was also something about this open back headphone that surprises at times with how it sounds.ConclusionsIf there ever was a company that built whatever it wanted and didn't care what people thought, is probably Grado. They still build these by hand (?) in New York to whatever metric they think sounds good.  Well, first impressions are that but it only last a minute of two.

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $149.I find the SV021 not only attractive to look at, but also touch given its luxurious fit and finish.  Hard to imagine it is such a low cost headphone!  Alas, the cups are a bit small for me and so not very comfortable.Let's put the SV021 on the GRAS measurement stand and see how it performs.SIVGA SV021 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurement:I usually align the response at 425 Hz.  Here, that is strangely the lowest output level with both bass and treble shooting way up.  I tried to get the bass to match in both channels but could not.  Maybe the pads are deformed differently or the driver response is different.   Relative response shows a lot of variation which may be hard to accurately EQ:Overall distortion is rather low but a couple of resonances stick way out:Seeing how we need to reduce the bass energy anyway, that region will look better post equalization.  Here is the absolute level of distortion:Group delay is not revealing of much:Impedance is flat and low:Combined with better than average sensitivity, it should be a relative easy headphone to drive:SIVGA SV021 Headphone Listening Tests and EQ:I started to listen to the headphone and it sounded good!  It was not until I created the filter set and performed AB that I realized that the out of box ""headphone showroom sound"" was flawed:Without the filters, the sound was closed in and just not interesting.  With the filters in place, the sound nicely opened up and bass tightened.  I threw in a couple of very sharp filters to reduce the resonances/distortions at the frequencies I measured.  Sighted, it seemed to reduce distortion and clean things up further.  With all 6 filters in place, I actually sat back and started to enjoy the sound of the SV021!  Spatial effects had improved fair bit and I could ""feel"" the notes and resolution of the music.  There was little to complain about other than slight discomfort.Lesson for people who say: ""listen before you measure.""  If I had done that, I would have told you that it sounded fine!  The truth come out in AB testing against equalized response which required measurements. ConclusionsWhile I really like the fit and finish of the SV021, the out of box tuning is clearly aimed at making a good first impression with a lot of bass and to some extent, treble. Likely this is why the average review rating on Amazon is 4.5 stars.  Are yourself with frequency response measurements, develop an EQ and now the headphone becomes very nice sounding.  Distortion is reduced to very low levels resulting in clean and well composed sound.Given how bad the out of box response is, I can't recommend the SIVGA Robin SV021.  If you own it though, deploy some EQ and you can get very good sound out of it.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly purchased by a member new and drop shipped to me.  It costs as little as $40 including free shipping on Amazon.Needless to say, you are looking at all plastic headphone here:It looks like you can adjust the headband but you can't.  Trust me, I tried at first.    the little pads on top are supposed to be a self-adjusting mechanism.  They kind of work but then put pressure on two small spots on your head.The cable terminates in a male connector which is unusual:The cups are on the larger side which helps a lot with comfort given the stiff spring action.  I would give it an 80 to 90% comfort after you wear them a few minutes.Superlux HD668B MeasurementsHere is the HD668B frequency response:We see good adherence to our target curve from 70 Hz to 2.5 kHz which is good.  But then we have a trough and two peaks.  We also have our usual bass drop off.   Subtracting the frequency response from our target we get this kind of deviation:As you see, we have huge variation in span of just a few Kilohertz as noted on the graph.  That first peak interestingly enough, correlates precisely with distortion at that frequency:That's good news in that we need to take down that peak anyway and with it, we will be also reducing distortion as a bonus.Unfortunately we are not helped with the high distortion in bass.  Boosting that may be a compromise between enough sub-bass response and more distortion.  More on this later in the equalization section.Here is our log display of distortion showing what we already know:Group delay is not very informative:By now you should know not to try to fix any large dips in the high frequencies as they are results of two waves cancelling each other.  Any EQ will change both resulting in the same cancellation.  This shows up as large group delay as indicated by the spike I have marked.Impedance vs frequency graph is a constant so no worry about the amplifier impedance being high (although you should avoid such amps anyway):Let me know if you like this kind of non-zoomed display better.  I think it is obscuring some info of interest in the graph but can be confusing to see it highly zoomed at first glance.Sensitivity is good (lower, better):Superlux HD668B Headphone Listening Test and EqualizationQuick listen showed somewhat exaggerated highs with grittiness added for good measure.  At the same time, there was a bit of dullness which I know is an oxymoron in that context.  Overall it was not a pleasant experience.  So let's try to fix the issues:Wow, what a transformation.  If blindfolded you and put these on your ears, you would swear you were listening to very expensive headphones.  The large drivers provide good bit of spatial information (separation of instruments), creating a soundstage that dangles from your ears down and to the back with the mono content behind your forehead.  This added effect combined with now good tonality and much deeper bass provided a very enjoyable experience.  Love the collaboration of Nick Cave and Nicholas Noorenbergh on this track for example:Let me indicate though that the sound can get a bit boomy (likely due to harmonic distortion of sub-pass) and the highs persisted to be a bit bright at times especially on female vocals.  A high frequency shelving filter would fix the latter but I wanted to stick to my philosophy of not piling on too many filters.  As I indicated, what is there already provides excellent performance.OK, I lied a bit.  There was something bugging me still.  When I played the track, Sever The Ego by Jewel:I kept hearing her voice to the left of center.  At first I ignored but then I realized same was happening in other tracks.  I looked back at the frequency response and realized that one channel is lower level across the board.  So I pulled up the Roon level controls and boosted the weak channel using pink noise:This nicely anchored the mono aspects of the track in the center, removing the hanging nail effect of channels not being balanced.ConclusionsWe have yet another example of an out of box objective and subjective performance that is disappointing.  You could try to forgive it given the cost but why?  With equalization this headphone (as with most) can outperform speakers costing thousands of dollars in tonality!  Fit and comfort is good enough and spatial effects very satisfying.  Wonderful experience is being had for $40 and a bit of software and signal processing.You can predict my summary then: no good as is but recommended with equalization.  And a bargain.Measurement data included, this time as .csv file.  Let me know if you like it better."

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $3,499.I must say, this is a manly looking headphone:It would fit right at home with someone wearing their leathers and driving a Harley Davidson motorcycle!    There is an unusual mechanism to adjust the headband which puts side ways pressure on the headphone.  I kind of like it.  Overall comfort is very good.This is the second heaviest headphone since I started to keep track of them at 575 grams:It doesn't feel that heavy though.  The inside cup dimensions are 70 mm, 56mm and 34 mm (height, width and depth).Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitting the LCD-24 to the fixture was extremely easy.  With the large cups and excellent seal, the first try worked and I ran with it.Audeze LCD-24 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our frequency response:Looks like some attempt is made in having a flat response even though there is ""ear gain"" in my fixture which doesn't make much sense.  End result is lack of bass and uninteresting, muffled sound due to shortages in the 1 to 5 kHz  We will confirm this in listening tests.As a deviation from target, this is what we have:I design my EQ by eye and in this case, creating a curve for 1 to 10 kHz is going to be challenging.  So automated filter design may work better.The next measurement popped the eye out of my socket:This is one comfortable driver no matter how much sound you expect it to produce!  Even at incredible 114 dBSPL, it is cruising with minimal distortion.  I hope companies that produce distortion factories (I am looking at you Abyss), are paying attention.  Distortion barely touches our 40 dB reference line:And that is in upper bass, dominated by second harmoni.Group delay is messy indicating internal reflections, resonances, etc:Impedance is typical dead flat but very low at 14 ohm:You need an amp that has good current delivery.  Fortunately efficiency is quite good:So most portable devices should be able to drive it to reasonable levels.Audeze LCD-24 Listening Tests and EqualizationStock listening experience was not good.  The sound was dull and sub-bass almost faint, non-existent.  So EQ tool came out fast and furiouis:Despite the crudeness of my EQ design, the transformation was massive.  You now had good sub-bass and the spatial qualities bloomed like nobody's business (function of 1 to 5 kHz).  Instrument separation was very nice and fun.  It feels like there is a miniature orchestra playing little instruments around your head.  One of my reference test tracks for spatial qualities (and general fidelity) is Jewele's Serve the Ego:The detail, resolution, bass and localization of different sounds was just excellent.  I just compared the youtube version above which plays without EQ compared to my Roon player doing so with EQ, and the difference is night and day.  The youtube version is totally uninteresting and recessed.  The EQ version is just a delight.  If you own this headphone and have not applied EQ correction, you don't know what you are missing.I wanted to compare my EQ to presets that ship in Roon for Audeze.  Alas, there was not one for LCD-24.  Hope Audeze remedies that.ConclusionsDespite the incredible popularity of headphone measurements and talk of preference curves, it is amazing how many headphones ignore that and produce a headphone with its idea of target response.  LCD-24 is one such example.  Fortunately it provides a capable platform for equalization with its extreme low distortion driver.  Producing an EQ curve takes some work but what I have above generates more fidelity and delight than I need.  I hope Audeze moves more towards having a response that is closer to target so that out of box experience is better.Overall, I cannot recommend Audeze LCD-24 in stock form.  With equalization though, it gets my strong vote for a wonderful sounding headphone.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.First harvest from the Garden!!! Been behind this year in my gardening chores so it was nice to have something ready to eat:The nice head of cauliflower came out of a plant that I potted back in fall of last year!  It produced some fruit which instantly got eaten by some creature. I put it in the greenhouse nearly dead looking.  This spring it sprouted back to action and produced to heads!  What a delight. Crunchy, flavorful and sweet.  Flowers you see are from kohlrabi which is normally grown for its over the ground bulb.  If you leave it in the garden though through winter, in spring you get this amazing harvest of yellow flowers that taste like broccoli.  I eat them while working in the garden all spring.  Below that is a smorgasbord of greens from different lettuces to beet greens and cilantro.On the right was a new planting: wasabi radish.  Was hoping that it would taste a bit like wasabi as advertised.  Well, it does not.  It just tastes like a normal radish, albeit in that pretty green color.  These were pulled out to let the others bulb out better.  They were decent eating.  And oh, I am growing real wasabi for the first time!Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was sent to me by the company and costs either US $1,299 or $1,799 depending on accessories.The LCD-XC feels quite sturdy and solidly built.  Alas, it is also the heavies headphone I have measured:The cups are quite comfortable for me and other than feeling some pressure against the sides of my head, I didn't have any problem wearing it for a while.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The LCD-X was easy to measure, fitting on my fixture with little adjustment.Audeze LCD-XC MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:I was pleasantly surprised to see good compliance with our target curve for a good part of it.  Headphone fixture reliability is low in high frequencies but it is possible that the sound is a bit bright due to peaks above 10 kHz for those of you blessed to still have your full hearing range.Relative frequency response (to our target) gives an easier view of what needs to be corrected using filters for optimal sound:As with some of the other Audeze headphones I have measured, the LCD-X demonstrates stunningly low levels of distortion:Even at 114 dBSPL (green) we have little to no distortion!  At reference measurement of 94 dBSPL (blue), distortion reduces to some -84 dB which is audio electronic domain, not a mechanical transducer!  Considering that there is some measurement noise in there as well, the actual distortion may be even lower.  If some of that weight has gone toward making less distortion, I say keep on adding weight!  In absolute terms, distortion again proves to be incredibly low:I suggest anyone performing audibility of distortion tests to use headphones like the LCD-XC.Group delay is also very clean showing absence of secondary resonances that combine to create phase non-linearity:Impedance is low and flat as is typical of this class:I again suspect some of that weight has gone toward making this headphone quite sensitive:Audeze LCD-XC Listening Tests and EqualizationOut of box response was fine.  Not annoying but a bit ordinary.  I first turned on the LCD-XC correction in my Roon player and it did improve the sound fair bit.  I then developed my own:The response is rather complex and my filters rather simple so a more optimal one may be developed using mathematical means.  Comparing mine to the built-in profile, I found that they are two flavors of excellent sound.  I have a slight preference for mine though.  Post EQ, spatial qualities were excellent with instruments taking up their own spot in 3-D space outside of each ear to the left and right with some depth.  On tracks that have such qualities, it is quite a nice experience.Bass performance with EQ was superb when combined with efficiency of these headphones.  With modest power driving them you can still get reference quality bass down to 20 Hz.  Turn up the volume some and dynamics become incredible.ConclusionsAudeze is one of only two companies providing headphones to me for testing.  For this alone, they deserve many kudos (as well as waiting some 6 months for me to test this headphone  ).  More importantly, I like how they have gotten closer to our preference curve and with it, provided a nice out of box experience.  Given the ultra low distortion, you can easily make corrections to the response to create the sound you want.  Efficiency is also high making it easier to drive than many other headphones.I am going to recommend the Audeze LCD-XC.  With EQ, I will up my recommendation to highest level!-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Are the masses right?  We are going to find out.The 35 II doesn't feel fancy, nor cheap:The cups are on the smaller side but fit my ears fine:They are on the softer side and seal well which means they wear warm.  Fine right now in winter but I suspect they may get too hot in summer.I briefly tested the noise cancelling function using my Audio Precision fan noise as stimulus.  Just wearing the 35 II was enough to kill 90% of the noise.  Turning it on removed the last bit but really, it was fine without it.  Noise sources with lower frequency content will likely show off the effect more.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Bose QuietComfort 35 II MeasurementsLet's start with frequency response of 35 II and comparison to our preference target to figure out tonality of the headphone, with the unit bot on and off:I first ran it with it powered off and was surprised how bad the response was.  Equally so, I was impressed once I turned it on and it not only flattened the variations in bass and mid-range but also pulled up the bass response to below 20 Hz!  Here is the powered on response again:That is pretty good tracking of our target response!  It is essentially perfect to 1 kHz.  Here is the relative variations:Good news extends to very low distortion at decent levels:Considering how much bass we already have -- so we don't have to boost it -- that is excellent level of distortion in that region.Here it is in absolute level:Again, remember that this is to be compared to post EQ for other headphones that are weak in bass.Clean, not fuzzy group delay shows that we have one radiator doing its job, not a bunch of other resonances mixing in:The entire curve is lifted up from 0 degree indicating a constant delay of about quarter of a millisecond.Impedance radically changes when the unit is on or off:Paradoxically, even though we are using the internal amplifier when the unit is on, it is not the most efficient headphone to drive:Bose QuietComfort 35 II Listening Tests and EqualizationI was instantly at ease with the tonality of the 35 II.   The clean and appropriate bass response was a delight.  Spatial qualities were a bit light and higher frequencies a tad dull so I put in a bit of salt and pepper on it:Once there, toe tapping started and I could listen endlessly to my test tracks.  So much so that I did not want to take them off to take the pictures for the review!As an aside, here is the EQ that I applied to AKG K371 headphone:So darn close!  Indeed the Bose could also use that broad light boost in pink filter I had in K371.  I wonder if Bose measured the response of the K371 and used that as the target for 35 II.  Anyone know which came first?ConclusionsAmazing what happens when you follow the science and tune a headphone to proper target curve.  You get a happy Amir who loves the 35 II with just a bit of EQ.  What else is there to say?The Bose QuietComfort 35 II gets my high recommendation if used with recommended EQ.  Without it, it is still recommended but just not as highly.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

The cups don't cover the artificial ear much so it is a crap shoot as far as seal you get and its impact on bass response.Audeze SINE MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response:As noted, bass response is not reliable as there is no way to achieve a seal on the fixture.  Past that though, we have surprisingly good compliance with our target up to 3 kHz.  This should bode well for out of box sound.  Past that we have a dip and that is about it.Relative response that is better to use to develop EQ reflects the same:Distortion in bass is typical but there is also something amiss where we unfortunately have a response hole:I don't mind distortion were we have excess energy as post EQ, that gets better.  Here it will be the opposite.  Fortunately the frequency is rather high so the impact won't be too bad.Group delay is very clean showing little interference:Planar magnetic headphones usually have a flat response so I was surprised to see a rise here:Finally, here is the sensitivity:Audeze SINE Listening Tests and EqualizationStory of measurements directly translate into listening results.  We no EQ the sound is pleasant but with little bass and high frequency energy.  You could certainly listen this way and be OK.  But ""OK"" is not in our vocabulary so out came the EQ tool:Now there was decent amount of bass and sparkle in highs.  Spatial qualities were also lifted and fun to notice from time to time.ConclusionsObjective faults of this headphone is just limited to two areas that were easy to fix with equalization.  Many headphones that deviate from the target do so in such extreme ways that I can't listen to them without EQ.  Not so with SINE.  It gets a large portion of the spectrum right.  You do need EQ however to create a true hi-fi experience out of it.Being discontinued, it is not a headphone I would go and chase on used market to buy.

Why such a chewed up response?  I don't think I have ever seen so many variations at such low frequencies in a headphone.  I had to filter the heck out of it to get some idea of what the response looked like:Is it me or the ups and downs have a repeating rhythm from 200 Hz to 2 kHz?  Anyway, not good no matter how you look at it including our relative frequency response:Distortion at 94 dB is low but we need to boost the very area where it is the highest:Every measurement points to the same acoustic disturbance including group delay:Typical of planar magnetics, its impedance is flat and low:Sensitive is a bit better than average:So you should be able to drive it with many devices.Rognir Listening TestsI was listening to my every day Dan Clark Stealth before switching to the Rognir and boy did it feel like someone turned the lights off!  Every bit of life got sucked out of music with no highs.  The sound was flat and boring with no spatial effects.  Given how bad the frequency response was, I was not hopeful that I could improve it much but I was wrong:Every filter worked to pull up the performance of this headphone.  The sum of those 5 filters transformed this headphone like nobody's business.  Spatial qualities came back in spades and combined with thundering sub-bass, it was a delight to listen to it.  Power handling is superb when driving it with my RME ADI-2 DAC, easily sticking a subwoofer in each of my ears as I turned up the volume for a second!   I was very surprised at the effect of the little filter at 880 Hz which I added at the end.  It really improved clarity of the headphone and seemed to reduce its distortion.ConclusionsCompany says they designed their own driver which I guess is good.  What is not good is that the design does not seem to have benefited from simple closed loop of measurements to identify the acoustic events that cause all the variations we have seen.  Out of the box the sound is just not good for any level of money let alone what they charge.  In a lucky turn of events however, equalization is superbly effectively in giving life to these headphones and making them quite worthwhile.Out of the box, I cannot in any shape recommend the Kennerton Rognir.

Concern is around a set of jagged peaks in higher frequencies witht he first one being the worst at 5.3 kHz.  The peaks seem to be distanced regularly at 900 Hz or double that.  Seems like the driver resonates at these regular intervals.  This means if you happen to have high pitched notes that are at these frequencies, they will be amplified and cause brightness.  But if you don't, then they won't and tonality will be more correct. Subtracting our response from the target preference curve we see the deviations more clearly:I was surprised by the high level of distortion:Not only do we have the classic distortion below 100 Hz or so, we also have some peaking around 270 Hz.  If you look at the frequency response graph, you see a bump in that area.  This is ""good news"" because we can take that bump down with equalization and with it, also reduce distortion.  Group delay shows the same issue:Back to distortion, here is the absolute level:Impedance varies with frequency:And at 40 ohm or so, it is pretty low.  So when you look at my headphone amplifier tests, pay attention to 33 ohm load tests for ability to drive this headphone. Good news is that the X2HR is rather efficient:Subjective Headphone Listening TestsThe immediate response is typical of peaking high frequency speakers and headphones: ""oh this sounds good.""  A few seconds later that changes to, ""but wait... it is quite bright!""  Per objective testing earlier, the brightness comes and goes.  Female vocals were annoying to listen as the sharpness would pierce your ear and then go away. Mind you, they were also ""attractive"" in that they were not too distorted and brought a great sense of spaciousness.  On that front, spatial qualities of the X2HR is quite good.Equalization was tougher than normal due to plurality of resonances:Usually equalization has completely positive results across the board.  Not quite here.  Shaving off those resonances also collapses the soundstage by some 20 to 30%.  That is such a nice effect that you hate to give up.  But give up I did as the headphones just sound way too bright to me.Note that even with my EQ, it still sounded a bit bright to me. I could get rid of that with increasing the strength of the shelving filter but then it would cost even more in soundstage.On bass eq, you notice that I dialed in very little of it.  The reason was distortion.  Turn up the level and each note clips.  Turned up even more and you get a sequence of ""brrrrrrr"" with which each ""r"" representing a tick.  ""Fortunately"" the clipping is gradual and proportional to volume and doesn't make you think the thing is going to blow up on you.  It is funny as in the first instance of hearing them it almost sounded like it was part of the music given its regular cadence.  So I reluctantly lowered the EQ to what you see there.  Without EQ, the problem is almost not there unless you listen very loud.  It seems that Philips has done most of the boosting they could already.ConclusionsThe Philips X2HR has a lot of good qualities at attractive price.  High comfort factor, good spatial effects, and nice tonality in low to lower treble.  If you are sensitive like I am though, the highs will get to you and get to you fast.  And again, if you are like me and want to listen loud to a track or two, the low frequency distortion can be annoying.Equalization salvages the headphone at the cost of some soundstage.  I personally would not buy it, hoping we can find another headphone in this price range that doesn't give us compromises as the EQ did here.I cannot recommend the Philips without EQ.  With EQ, it is close to getting my recommendation.  At the end, I decided to pass.  You may disagree and I would be fine with it.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $449.The S5X looks nice and differentiated.  Comfort was very good. Alas, the sample I received had a pretty crushed left cup (on top) which made it harder to get matching channel response.  Company advertises it as: ""Reference class, open back, dynamic headphones with flat frequency response for binaural/immersive mixing made in the EU.""  Let's see if it does that.Ollo S5X MeasurementsWe start with our usual frequency response measurement:Response is kind of flat but something is causing that opposing kink between 200 and 300 Hz.  For our use which is enjoyment of music, it likely is deficient in both bass and lower treble which images spatial qualities.  High frequency seems to comply with our target with all the peaks reaching the target.Relative response to our target shows a complex shape:It will be interesting to see if I can develop a set of filters for it to flatten that curve.When it comes to distortion, that kink in frequency response manifests itself in a lot of impairment:It seems that the industry is so focused on frequency response that such simple distortion measurements are not performed to catch what is clearly a flaw.It is so bad that even our group delay shows it:And even impedance measurement!Sensitive is better than average though so it should be an easy drive for most sources:OLLO Audio S5X Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationFirst impression was a sound that was inoffensive and not exciting.  So I decided to apply EQ:It took some trial and error to optimize the highest frequency filter.  I was amazed how much difference that filter at 213 Hz made.  I think the harmonics of that distortion were polluting the spectrum above above.With all of these filters in place, the sound was delightful courtesy of angled drivers that provided neat spatial effects.  There was plenty of bass and the sound was much more open due to higher frequency boosts.ConclusionsThe S5X has a clear flaw in upper bass area which manifests itself in a lot of distortion. Its frequency response is as claimed (""flat"") but that is not what we like as audiophiles.  Fortunately it is fairly fixable in EQ and as is typical, transforms the experience in a dramatic way.  You can now sit back and really enjoy your music. At the same time, if you have to use it without EQ in some other secondary situations, the sound is not bad.I can't recommend the OLLO Audio S5X as is.  With EQ it gets much better.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $4,000 (not a typo).The Utopia appropriately gives off a luxury feel:The comfort was excellent despite the 500 gram weight without the heavy cord.  The latter is super thick and weighs 185 grams by itself.  The inside cup dimensions are 51 by 59 mm.  And it is 23 mm deep.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Mounting the headphone on the text fixture was easy requiring almost no manipulation to get proper meausrements.Focal Utopia MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our stereo frequency response measurements:As noted, we have our bass droop which is substantial as it is not even flat. Between 100 Hz and 1.7 kHz response fairly closely resembles our target.  We then have some deficiencies but the highs seem to then hug the curve.  There is some noise around 1.5 to 2.5 kHz which we also see in the Group Delay graph:I don't know if it is diffraction, reflections or what.  I prefer to not see this in high-end headphone.Back to our frequency response, here is the deviation from target:Distortion is exceptionally low at higher frequencies and only gets bad at 114 dBSPL:Impedance is quite uneven so best to use a solid state amp with low impedance to drive the Utopia:Fortunately efficiency is good:Focal Utopia Listening TestsAs is, the Utopia sounded just fine.  Not a whole lot to rave about but no glaring, annoying response errors.  As expected, deep bass was absent so out came the EQ:I dialed in my quick shelving filter to bring out subbass.  I increased its bandwidth to 70 Hz but was not sure that was a good trade off so went back to 50 Hz.  A more precisely filter may work better.  Tune this to your taste.Above that, I dialed in two filters to fill in the dips in the response.  As I have noted before, any increase in this region also has a nice bonus of increasing spatial effects.  On this note, the Focal Utopia with this EQ is a delight to listen to.  You get a halo of sound about 25 to 30% outside of your head with very nice instrument separation and excellent clarity.  I wish I had the Sennheiser HD-800S to compare but what is there, reminds me of that headphone.  Whatever magic Sennheiser has found there, Focal seems to have discovered as well.ConclusionsObjectively we have the ""old school"" frequency response tuning with deficient sub-bass response and some in the upper mid-range, lower treble.  What is missing is not significant enough to leave you disappointed if you paid $400.  But at $4,000, you better find a way to add EQ and get the sound to the next higher level.I struggled with what grade to give the Utopia.  It straddles the fence between recommended and ""happily recommended"" with the latter being with EQ.  At the end, I went with the latter.EDIT: my son helped me with this review.  Hoping over time he can do more of these since he likes headphones.  And it frees me up to test other products.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was sent to me by the company and costs US $1,199 by itself or you can get the premium version with case and such for $1,699.The LCD-X is one serious looking and feeling headphone:I am not a big fan of its adjustment mechanism as shipped.  It is hard to adjust just one notch.  It either doesn't move or overshoots.  I understand there is an adjustment mechanism for this which I did not play with.This is a substantial headphone clocking at 610 grams which I understand is lighter than its original version:Wearing it though, I found them pretty comfortable.  I quickly forgot about them until I took them off and then felt the pressure the pads were putting on my face.The cup inside dimensions are rectangular at 67mm by 50 mm.  The depth is variable and at its highest is 26 mm.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was very easy given the large pads. Audeze 2021 LCD-X MeasurementsAs usual we start with the headphone frequency response as comparison to our preference curve:We immediately see that the deep notch that existed in the original LCD-X is fixed:A bit of boost is also provided around 2 to 3 kHz which is appreciated but still not enough to reach the natural gain of our hearing anatomy.  The trough between 3 and 5 kHz will likely cause significant damage to spatial qualities of the headphones.  Here is the relative frequency response which is useful for development of the needed equalization:Bass deficiency is not much but still, you want to EQ that.  It would be a shame to get a large driver like this and not let it produce proper bass!Here is the best news:Distortion is extremely low (ignore the bit at 10 kHz -- it is not repeatable).  If you boost the response by 10 dB, you only travel from blue curve to red which is almost no difference!  Even 20 dB gets you to green curve which is again nothing.   Our 40 dB target is easily reached across the full range:This makes the headphone a blank canvas to equalize as we wish.Group delay says very little:Impedance is flat as is typically the case with planar magnetic headphones:Sensitivity is slightly better than average:Combined with low impedance, you should be able to drive the LCD-X with most headphone outputs.Audeze LCD-X Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationThe sound out of box is quite boring and bland.  So equalization tool came right out:I used dual filters to try to better shape the low frequency boost as it has a complex shape.  I then used another pair to fill in the hole in 3 to 5 kHz.  The final filter in yellow at 5.8 kHz is just a ""stopper.""  I use a bit of negative gain to make sure there is no boost at that point and farther in frequency response.  It helped keep the headphone from sounding too bright post EQ.Once there, these headphones were a delight to listen to.  The sound is now light and airy with really good spatial qualities.  Dynamic ability is excellent letting you listen at any level with no hint of distortion.  The sound is so nice that a day later, I am listening to them as I type this review.  ConclusionsIt is great to see Audeze respond to clear flaw shown in measurements and fix the egregious rough/cancellation that existed in the older design.  What is there now is improved in that regard from tonality point of view but is still far from ideal response.  A lot of goodness is left on the table with deficient lower treble and deep bass.  Once those are fixed the sound becomes wonderful given the exceptionally low level of distortion.  I am happy to strongly recommend the Audeze LCD-X 2021 revision with equalization.  Without it, it is a pass for me.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was VERY difficult. It would not fully surround the artificial ear, and I could not get it to fully seal no matter what I did. Slight movements and changes would vary the levels but in practice, I noticed frequency response did not substantially change. Still, be on notice that my confidence in measurements are not super high (although EQ settings verified that they were good enough for that purpose).Neumann NDH20 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response:I was quite surprised by this response.  Given Neumann's heritage for neutrality in speakers, I expected a flat and bass shy response.  Instead we have plenty of bass but then a suck out in the 1 to 3 kHz.  We also have a deep cancellation around 2.6 kHz.  I am not used to seeing such at such a low frequency.  Relative response therefore shows somewhat a ""V"" response:Distortion is very good considering that we don't need to boost the bass where it rises:Something is definitely not right around 2.5 to 3 kHz though. We see the same in Group Delay:It seems like a strong resonance of sorts out of phase with the response of the driver.Impedance is middle of the road and mostly fixed:Sensitivity is decent:Headphone Listening TestsFirst impression is not bad.  You can hear the emphasis in bass and also some accentuation of highs.  It is not until you dial in some EQ that you realize the imbalance:I had to play a lot with these dials as the sound wound up being too bright after my initial correction.  I was mostly happy with it but not quite there.  It is possible some would prefer the heavier bass response.Sub-bass response as you would expect is excellent.ConclusionsThis was a surprising outcome from Neumann.  I expected a more neutral headphone but instead got a bass heavy one.  Even though I am a fan of bass, it needs to be balanced relative to the rest of the response.  I find that when the 1 to 3 kHz is sucked out, the sound becomes closed in which is a death sentence in my book for headphones as they already bad in that regard.Equalization helps a lot but needs more refinement to get to a good place.I can't recommend the Neumann NDH20 without EQ.  With EQ, it barely gets there.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

But due to large cups, they are reasonably comfortable.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The K271 has a self-adjusting mechanism which makes it hard to put high pressure on the test fixture. There was fair amount of variability in how I seated the unit.  I did manage to get better fit/channel matching than the previous version.AKG K271 MK II Chinese MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:The family resemblance is quite strong to previous K271 I measured.  Then again there are differences such as lower amplitude between 2 and 4 kHz.  Overall it is flawed with not only deviations from the target but glitches here and there:The variations will make it difficult to develop an EQ by eye due to shapes not matching typical parametric EQ curves.As with previous version, distortion is through the roof at lower frequencies:This sample has a problem around 3 kHz which the other one did not.  Absolute distortion level is such:Group delay is much messier than the other version:And impedance variation is higher as well:This measurement is less subject to fitment on the measurement rig so may be pointing to variation in design.Sensitivity is pretty much the same:Listening TestsI reported the previous version sounded OK without EQ.  This one did not although I have been listening to my reference headphone all day which I was not when I tested the other.  The sound as is, is dull, lacking bass and detail.  Not offensive as a result but nothing I would want to listen to.  I pulled up the previous EQ for the K271 and made a number of adjustments to it for this sample:Once there, the sound was very good.  Bass though was insufficient and as is, would crackle and distort.  There was also a resonance of sorts that would make string instruments sound strange at times.  Still, I could enjoy the headphones on reference tracks such as what you see above.ConclusionsThere are enough vagaries in headphone measurements that I can't swear the Chinese manufactured one is different than what is produced elsewhere.  Going by what we have in hand, there seems to be degradation both objectively and subjectively.  EQ is quite helpful though in taming them and turning this headphone into something quite usable.Overall, I can't recommend the Chinese made AKG K271 without EQ.

It is on kind loan from a member.  The PM3 is discontinued but seems to have quite a following and hence the reason I wanted to test it.  Originally it cost US $399 but I see used prices from $500 up to $800.  Typical of Oppo products, it holds its value well and even appreciates!I am not a fan of the look of the cups but otherwise, there is a nice luxury feel and look to this headphone especially in white:A 3.5 mm cable connects at both ends which is convenient.  Note however that you need a slim fitting one at the headphone side.  The cable supplied has a larger one at one end which would not fit right on the headphone until I reversed it.The cups are small and I can feel them on my ears.  The softness of the super supple pads help.  Width and length of the cup inside dimensions are 60x40mm.  Depth is 20mm.Noise isolation is very good.  It would block almost 80% of the noise from my Audio Precision's fan.  Best noise cancelling headphones land at 95%+ and less good ones at 90% so this is very good.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was challenging even though the cups easily covered the artificial ear on my measurement fixture.  This resulted in fairly large variations in bass response.  I got the two channels to match which is a good sign but still, keep in mind the cautions above in bold.Oppo PM3 MeasurementsAs usual we start with the headphone frequency response as comparison to our preference curve: First thing that stands out is the hump between 60 and 300 Hz.  Other measurements show it less pronounced.  And if I lowered the levels, I could make it less so even here.  Listening tests have to confirm whether it is this exaggerated or not.  Below and above this hump, we have surprisingly good compliance with our target.  Response is ""dirty"" however with a number of kinks, likely caused by resonances.  We have a bit of deficiency between 3 and 4 kHz and exaggerated peak around 7 to 8 kHz.  Overall, this is not half bad.  Here is the relative response for equalization purposes:Distortion is exceptionally low at bass frequencies especially as we consider that we already have enough or even too much energy there:Unfortunately there are a lot of resonant peaks in higher frequencies.  These could be the driver, the enclosure, or both.  If you go back to the frequency response measurements, you can see traces of the same there.Here it is in absolute log form:Group delay doesn't tell us much except maybe confirming a resonance around 2 kHz:Impedance is flat and low like most planar magnetics:Sensitivity is above average so should not be hard to drive:Oppo PM3 Listening Tests and EqualizationSome people accuse me of liking ""bass.""  There is no better proof of this being wrong than me saying I did not at all like the bass response in the PM3.  It is bloated.  What I like is sub-bass response where there is almost never too much of a good thing.    What is here is way too much and too high of a frequency which overwhems the tonality of the rest of the headphone.  Add to that the lack of lower treble energy and the sound is not to my liking at all.  Everything you play has some amount of ""hmmmm"" bass to it, whether it should or not.So I pulled out the EQ and went after the three area of concern:Once again I used dual filters to shape the response for bass (and amounts visually adjusted and hence the fractions).  Measurements were correct in the level and magnitude of bass error.  With this correct, deep bass is now a delight and the rest of the tonality gets to shine, well with the addition of the two filters.Spatial qualities are good post EQ.  I give it B+.I am still listening them as I type this -- a sign of being happy with the sound of the headphone.  ConclusionsIt is always nice to test ""iconic"" products and the Oppo PM3 is one. I can see some of the appeal it has in compliance with the Harman target in sub-bass and midrange.  Exceptionally low distortion in bass helps with the clarity and clean sound here.  This said, I can't listen to it without EQ.  There is just too much boominess and missed sparkle in the lower treble.I am happy to recommend the Oppo PM3 with Equalization.  It is a pass for me without but it is not offensive for every day listening like some headphones are.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

That bass deficiency may be partly due to seal but still, we basically have no bass.  There is some kind of resonance around 2.5 kHz and response then drops way off.  In other words, this is as close to one-note headphone as we can get.Relative response puts this in context relative to our target:Distortion however was extremely low:Then again we have a ton of boosting to do.Group delay is clean and not revealing of much:Sensitivity matches the average of all headphones tested so far:Impedance is high and somewhat variable:KOSS PRO/4AA Listening Tests and EqualizationBoy, does this thing sound flat and lacking in just about everything that makes music hi-fidelity.  There is no bass or treble.  I almost stopped there thinking it could not be salvaged with EQ.  But I was wrong:The transformation was dramatic.  It was the classic toad turning into a prince!  OK maybe that not far but you get the picture.  There was even decent spatial effects now.  Deep bass was pronounced but had a weird distortion about it.  I took the levels down and it helped with that but then I thought bass was lacking with other tracks that were not bass heavy.  After some back and forth, I left it as you see.ConclusionsIn researching this headphone, I ran into this Stereophile review for a slightly different version of it:I don't think I have ever read such blunt and negative review in stereophile!

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $118 on Amazon including prime shipping.I understand if you buy them new, you get two sets of pads.  The sample I have only came with the ""leather"" one:The headphone is ultra light and feels quite plasticky.  You certainly don't get a feeling that you bought something of value.  The pads are quite shallow (maybe they are worn?) to the tune of 16 mm, the lowest I have measured on any over the ear headphone.  As such, they pushed the artificial ear lobes on my fixture and my own ear.  I did not mind it much though.  As mentioned, they are extremely light:Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The K271 has a self-adjusting mechanism which makes it hard to put high pressure on the test fixture.  I could see some air gaps when I fit it there and observed high variability in bass performance.  So be mindful of this when you see the follow on measurements.AKG K271 ohm MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements: At first blush, this looks scary bad.  But when you look past the kinks here and there, the compliance with our target curve in the critical range of 200 Hz to 3 kHz is quite good!    Below that we have messy bass response but that could be due to measurement error as evidenced by green channel doing better (which I could confirm visually to be the case).  At the highest frequencies we have a bit of excess energy but not much.  Here is our relative frequency response measurement:The relative distortion graph looks really bad in bass because the response is dropping while distortion is increasing there:Maybe the super light weight of this headphone and not so tight fit on the fixture is causing its body to resonate or something.  We will circle back to this (sort of) when we perform our listening tests.Group delay just confirms there are point frequency issues in this design:Of note, there is no fuzziness in mid frequencies yet as you will read in the subjective section, there is very good spatial effects.Impedance is on the low side and somewhat variable:Sensitivity is a bit better than average:Combined with lowish impedance, you should be able to drive the K271 with portable devices.AKG K271 Listening TestsWhile not perfect, out of the box tonality was close to what I expected to hear.  My reference tracks immediately sounded (almost) right.  Some equalization with substantial boost in bass transformed this headphone's performance:Wow or wow!  This thing has incredible bass now and very nice spatiality.  I ran the tests yesterday and today I am still listening to them!  Track after track sounds wonderful.As to bass distortion, I can't hear it unless I blast it and then it starts to rattle and such.  But at any reasonable level, it sounds very clean counter to the measurements.Was just listening to the track, Je Suis Une Fleure, from the album Best Kept Secretes Part 2 by Shigeru Umebayashi makes you think you have died and gone to heaven:ConclusionsWhat is the old saying?  Don't judge a book by its cover?  So is the story of AKG K271.  Out of the box it is mostly fine but not exciting.  Add some EQ and this headphone transforms into jewel, something that is hard to find in closed back headphones.  The large cups provide for very nice spatial effects.  Combine this with the low price and you have a winner here.I am going to recommend the AKG K271.  With equalization, it almost earns a golfing panther!  I would give it such if I was not worried about you all chasing me out of town that such a cheap headphone with seemingly messy measurements would achieve such.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,799.99.The Ether flow is an attractive headphone and pretty comfortable to wear. It comes with different set of pads. Owner bought it used so was not sure what is default.  I am not either .  So I measured the Right channel (red below) with a thick black pad and left the other one the way it was (an open transparent mesh).Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results.

If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!It was non-trivial to get the same bass performance for both channels on the fixture.  But after some trying, I got there.Dan Clark Audio Ether Flow 1.1 MeasurementsAgain, note that the right channel in red has an extra pad:This is a pretty odd response. There is no part of our target curve that is adopted. We also have interesting set of resonant peaks which seem to diminish with the extra pad.  EQ will be darn necessary.  To that end, here is your guide:On very good news front, there is essentially no distortion even at punishing 114 dBSP!Group delay is not revealing of much other than some messiness:Impedance is flat and low:Which when combined with about average sensitivity means it is an easy headphone to drive:Dan Clark Audio Ether Flow 1.1 Listening Tests & EQThe immediate impression was that of the somewhat exaggerated upper bass/warmth.  You could listen to them as is because it is not annoying in any regard.  But EQ is mandatory to bring out what this headphone can do.  The complex shape of the deviations made it a bit difficult but I managed to get there up to a few kHz:Strategy was a dip for the resonant peak and then two PEQs to boost the whole region.  Upper bass was pulled down and low bass pulled up to taste.  Depending on good your high frequency hearing is, you may want to play with pulling those resonant peaks down as well.Me?  I was satisfied and was blown away by the incredible fidelity I was hearing with those 5 filters.  The track you see on the snapshot of Roon was to die for with amazing resolution and detail. You cold almost feel the strings courtesy of very nice spatial qualities. The high sensitivity allowed my RME ADI-2 Pro to drive them up to as high a level as I wanted with thundering bass that resonated the cups and my ear!  I wish I didn't have to take pictures of the headphone for the review so I could keep listening to them!Let say that I did not expect to be able to correct the response as well as I did. It was tempting to just write off the headphone and not bother. But owner had told me to try so I am glad I did.ConclusionsThere is no question that the stock frequency response is off compared to what research tells us it should be.  Even though the deviations are broad, the stock sound is not annoying so in a pinch you could use it as is. But add half a dozen filters to your EQ datapath and the ETher Flow 1.1 comes to life like nobody's business. Credit likely goes to good bones in the form of incredibly low distortion.  To some extent, maybe the headphone we want is an extremely low distortion one we can EQ as we need!Price is up there though so I can't recommend the Dan Clark Audio Ether Flow 1.1 open if you are going to use them as is.  If you can pick one up used and add EQ though, you have a winner there.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

This resulted in fairly large variations in bass response. I got the two channels to match which is a good sign but still, keep in mind the cautions above in bold.HD58X Jubilee MeasurementsAs usual we start with the headphone frequency response as comparison to our preference curve:Track is close to our target up to 2 kHz.  HD650 as a comparison, did better past that:Both are bass shy and will need equalization.  Unfortunately distortion as with HD650 is rather high in bass:Back to frequency response, here is our relative curve for building an EQ:Impedance is markedly lower than HD650:Combined with better sensitivity, it should be easier to drive:Group delay has a few distinct notches which can also be traced to wiggles in the frequency response:There are likely resonances mixing with the direct sound of the driver causing phase errors.HD58X Listening Tests and EqualizationAs with HD-650, out of box experience is fine and definitely usable.  No reason to settle for it though as much better performance can be had with equalization:Once there, the sound was delightful with surprisingly good amount of spatial qualities (I give it B+).  I listened for the rest of the evening after I tested and did not want to put it down.Compared to HD-650, the HD58X was noticeably louder so direct comparison was not possible.  I was too lazy to set up dual headphone amps & DACs (to EQ each separately) with volume matching for this review.  Will do that for future ones.ConclusionsHard to know if Sennheiser attempt to produce a lower quality headphone in dropping the price so much.  What is there is very close to HD650 at a fraction of the price.  With EQ, this headphone sounds darn good and is a superb value for just $170.

It is on kind loan from a member and goes for US $8 to $10 on auction sites.I am told this is the headphone that was bundled with likes of discman in the olden days when those products were popular.  The RP-HT16 naturally weighs very little and was very comfortable to wear during my testing.Fitment of the on-ear headphones on a measurement fixture is tricky as there is no clear guidelines for where it should land on the artificial ear.  Lack of a sealed enclosure means bass response is not going to be there (same is true for listening).  So accept the following measurements as grossly accurate but not in the micro detail.If you are new to my headphone measurements, please watch this video first.Panasonic RP-HT16 Headphone MeasurementsAs usual, let's start with our headphone frequency response measurement:Wow, it is hard to miss that massive peak at 2.6 kHz. It stands out like the proverbial sore thumb. You will notice its impact in just about every measurement you are about to see.  Outside of that we lack bass as noted and treble energy between 4 kHz and 10 kHz.  EQ will therefore be mandatory to pull this headphone out of the gutter:Clearly this headphone is not meant to play loud:Even at 94 dBSPL, we have distortion rising to 1% between 1.5 and 3 kHz.  Fortunately we will be using EQ to pull some of that region down so that should help.You can see the correlation of distortion and frequency response quite well in absolute distortion measurements:Whoever says distortion measurements are not instructive in testing headphones needs to take a look at the RP-HT16.Our friendly resonance also shows up in group delay:And even in impedance graph:The RP-16 was also surprisingly insensitive for this class of headphone:Still, you should be able to get decent volume out of typical portable device.Panasonic RP-HT16 Listening Tests and EqualizationI usually stop listening to my everyday music and go to my reference test tracks for testing headphones/speakers.  But here, I was in the middle of a nice album and thought I just disconnect my Dan Clark Stealth headphones and switch to Panasonic RP-HT16.  I forget the track/album but I will never forget that I heard the worst sound out of any headphone I have tested!  Not only was the tonality wrong but there was this streaky/scratchy lower treble that completely ruined any enjoyment to be had out of that track.  The measurement foretold a bad response but hearing it was a completely different matter.  So out came the EQ tool:The low hanging fruit was that resonance so I installed filter Band 2.  The difference was incredible!  Gone was the screechy distortion and very odd tonality.  You could stop there and congratulate yourself for a job well done.  But the the sound was now dull and not exciting.  I attempted to pull up the bass and it basically did nothing to help there but add some distortion at higher levels.  So changed the shelving filter for band 1 to a PEQ and just rose it enough until I got some warmth and then stopped.There was a bit of boominess that filter 5 took care of.  The sound was made more open using 6.5 kHz filter with 1 kHz band 4 adding a bit of salt to our mix.Once there, the headphone was transformed with nigh and day difference.  You could almost call it high-fi!FYI the resonance needs content to hit it.  In the middle of testing someone sent me a youtube clip to listen to (which doesn't go through my EQ set).  That did not hit on the resonance and the sound even without EQ was fine.  This is why it is critical to listen to the right material to test speakers/headphones.And oh, good luck knowing about that resonance at 2.6 kHz by just listening.  No way you would know the problem and of course, how to fix it with EQ.  In my book, listening to speakers/headphones without benefit of measurements is just wrong.ConclusionsI can see how the RP-HT16 would need to cost $2 to $3 to make leaving a budget of a few pennies for each driver.  Still, I wish a bit of work had gone into fixing that nasty resonance.  That alone would have made a dramatic improvement in the clarity and tonality of this headphone.  Fortunately we have EQ tools and pulling down a resonance not only fixes the frequency response, but also drastically reduces distortion.  Result is more clarity and better tonality.  Compliance with our target required a few more filters.  Once there, you could sit back and enjoy these dirt cheap headphones comfortably.Not that you would want to rush and buy these but sticking to protocol, I can't recommend the Panasonic RP-HT16.---------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you have audio gear you want me to review, please read this post: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/we-measure-audio-equipment-for-free.1995/Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Not sure what is up with that peak resonance above 5 kHz.  EQ is mandatory and here is the graph to build from:Distortion is similar to other Sennheisers being dominant in bass:The redesign from HD650 seems to have been to lower the impedance:This is half as much, reducing the dependency on high output voltage from the amp (i.e. making it more mobile friendly).  Sensitivity is average:Group delay is messy:Sennheiser HD660S Listening Tests and EqualizationOut of the box sound was very good, proving that you need to EQ (or compare to another neutral headphone) to know what you are missing.  After inserting three filters, I was shocked how much the tonality and overall fidelity improved:The bass boost is self explanatory.  The middle filter made a substantial improvement to its spatial qualities which was a delight to listen to now.  The last filter doesn't make a tonal difference but seems to have the effect of lowering distortion.I had an easy time driving the HD660S with my RME ADI-2 DAC.  It sounded superb (with EQ) up to reasonably loud levels.  Above that I thought the bass became less distinct but that was not safe or long term listening level.With the EQ I sat back and enjoyed the sound with track after track.  Turn it off and sound collapses with a more mundane but not annoying tonality.Comfort was great compared to my much heavier everyday headphone.  But after half hour the tips of my ears were starting to become uncomfortable a bit. ConclusionsThe core DNA of this line of headphones from Sennheiser seems to be maintained in this revision.  Response is a bit more rough than HD650 but both need EQ anyway.  And with it, you have a very top performing headphone.  I am going to put the Sennheiser HD660S on my recommended list.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly loaned to me by a member and costs US $700.The Elex naturally follows the design of the rest of Focal line:The headphone weighs 440 grams and has inside cup dimensions of 62x55x27 (height, width, depth).  Note that the driver is angled so the cup depth varies.Overall comfort was excellent.  The owner must have a similar shape to my face and head as to have worn off the pads just right.  Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Mounting the headphone on the text fixture was easy requiring very little manipulation to get left and right to match at dual frequencies (within reason).Focal Elex MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our stereo frequency response measurements:That sure looks similar to Focal Clear frequency response:The only thing different is better channel matching in Elex which could be a measure difference as much as sample difference. Even the Focal Utopia looks similar:Looks like they have their own target response that all of these are matched to.Back to Elex, the relative frequency response is thus:Group delay matches as well:I have noted a member's hypothesis that messiness in group delay in that 2 to 4 kHz may result in better spatial effect.As if we need any more proof of sisterhood between the Clear and Elex, here is the distortion graph which matches yet again:One difference though: this time I did not have my own headphones on and listened to the sweeps.  I was horrified to hear the drivers crackle at 114 dBSPL!  The clear must have done this as well given that signature response in green:So whoever thinks the driver limitations here is imagined, well, they need to stop saying that.   On the positive front is the incredibly low distortion at 94 dBSPL (blue).  The line literally melts into the ""0"" percentage.  Even at 114 dBSPL, there is no distortion to speak of above 2 kHz.  So as long as you don't hit the limit of the drive, this is one low distortion transducer.  Maybe that is the trade off they made?Here is the distortion graph in absolute scale:Impedance is variable and again matches Clear:Sensitivity is good requiring half as much drive as Sennheiser HD-650 for example:Focal Elex Listening TestsAs with the Focal Clear, the non-equalized response was fine but nothing to get excited about.  Similar equalization (created from scratch here rather than copied from Clear), resulted in major improvement:I may be biased by distortion measurements but I constantly went ""oh that note is clean!""  This happened across the board in many tracks.  Quiet notes were especially a delight with the Elex.It was not long though before I got horrified with the crackling sound.  Oh man is this thing scary.  The only audio gear that I am scared of is my 1000 watt power amplifier which has enough juice to send a speaker to Mars!    The Elex headphone had me in the same spot where I had to have my hand on the volume control.  I could not enjoy any track at high volume as I kept worrying about the crackle. So I turned the volume down and got busy with another review.  A couple of hours later, I realized how comfortable this headphone was and how nice its sound was at low volumes.ConclusionsLet's cut to the chase: if the Focal Elex did not have the driver limit with that nasty crackle, it would get the highest remarks from me.  It has an utlra low-distortion driver that lends itself well to equalization.  Once there, the sound is a delight as long as you keep the volume reasonable and sensible.  Equalization sadly gets you closer to its limit and in my application would surely hit the limit.  What a shame.I am over the shock of the driver limit that I had with the Clear and decided to upgrade my rating of Elex to ""recommended.""  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Company reached out to me a couple of years ago to see if I would review them.  At the time I was not testing headphones so said no but that I could use a low impedance headphone to test headphone amps.  They offered the Ether CX and that is the main role they have had.  Currently the Ether CX costs US $900 from drop.com.I have been remiss in reviewing these because I have so many loaner headphones to test.  Alas, it seems every day someone reaches out to me asking when I will test them so here we are.The Ether CX has a professional and stylistic look to it with the carbon fiber finish:Two sturdy XLR cables terminate in a 4-pin XLR with supplied adapters to other sockets. Ether CX is a bit on the heavier side given its large size:I find them comfortable to wear despite the unique rectangular inside cup:Inside dimensions are 58x38x16 mm (height, width, depth).  The one issue I have with comfort is how hot they wear.  Due to generous pad area, they are quite warm to the point where I can't use them during summer.  My lab is in the loft so heat rises and forces me to use IEMs for the most part during this time of year.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!I expected difficulty in mating the Ether CX to my measurement rig due to rectangular opening but such was not the case.  They fit instantly with little need for adjustments.Ether CX MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:It was interesting to measure these after two years of using them without such knowledge.  It was as relief to see such a well-behaved response that hugs the preference curve above 100 Hz.  Below that it is not some wild response either: it is flat which shows an intent to get proper response there, albeit, not fully matching latest research.Relative response then looks very good:The best news was yet to come in the form of exceptionally low distortion:Even when pushed to 114 dBSPL, this headphone has less distortion than many at 94 dBSPL!  We should be used to that with Dan Clark headphones but still nice to see in design after design:Now you know why this is such a powerful tool for testing headphone amplifiers.  When I hear distortion, it is almost always the amplifier clipping, not the headphone.Group delay shows very response other than bass:Impedance is low and flat as expected:So best pay attention to my 32 ohm load testing of headphone amplifiers.Sensitivity is slightly below average:Drop Ether CX Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationOut of box tonality his fine but not exciting.  So I pulled out the EQ tool to add the needed sub-bass and touch up higher up:The performance was stellar now.  Spatial qualities which were non-existent before, showed up now. I would rate it a score B on that front.  Sub-bass output post EQ was exceptional producing powerful notes that put a smile on my face.  ConclusionsThe Drop Ether CX is a very well engineered headphone.  It has vanishingly low distortion and a frequency response that is just missing sub-bass to be a complete presentation.  That is easy enough fix as is a bit of treble boosting to improve spatial effects.  Once there, you have a very nice closed back headphone which blocks out external noise nicely and produces very clean and faithful performance.  Without EQ, it lacks excitement for me to use it but you may be different.I can recommend the Drop+ Ether CX and strongly so with Equalization.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.

We then have some shortfall between 1.8 to 5 kHz which usually means degraded spatial qualities.  After that, accuracy of measurements go down but there can be some excess treble energy above 7 kHz.Subtracting the response from our target gives us the relative deviation from our target for development of equalization filters:At 94 dBSPL distortion is exceedingly small matching company's claims (generally) in this regard:But we have two narrow spikes which usually indicate resonances.  One is near 1 kHz again.  Here is the same but in absolute dB scale:Group delay shows disturbance at the low frequency tuning of the driver:Impedance is highly variable and once again shows a resonance around 1.8 kHz:Sensitivity is below average but not terribly so:Meze Liric Listening Tests and EqualizationImmediate response was a rather dull sound but not disturbingly so.  As such, you could use it without EQ without it being bothersome.  Equalization highly lifts the performance:I initially corrected for sub-bass response but that resulted in less energy in that region to I disabled that filter (Band 1).  I also took down the boost a bit at Band 4 as I thought it sounded too bright.  That wasn't enough so I pulled down the peak at 8.5 kHz.  Final results was a tad bright but brought with it excellent tonality and very good spatial effects.  Detail and resolution was excellent and I wanted to keep listening and listening.ConclusionsObjectively we have fair bit of deviation from our target here but fortunately, most of it is excess energy so we can easily pull down and get the bonus of less distortion to boot.  Once there, performance is excellence and compared with the nice fit (on my head), I found the experience quite enjoyable.  Should a $2,000 headphone match our target?  Ideally so but the industry has yet to adopt this stance so we continue to get dual personality headphones: not so good as is, and excellent with EQ.I can't recommend the Meze Liric without EQ.  With EQ, it becomes superb sounding especially for a closed back headphone so definitely recommended that way.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $327 on Amazon.I find the K712 cute and cheerful:The huge cups (64mm inside diamater/24mm deep) fit over my ear fine.  But I thought the cups didn't compress enough and after a while, I could feel their slight pressure on head.  Ditto for the headband.  I would rate it as 90% comfortable.Plastic components help keep the weight lower:A mini XLR socket is provided which you can use to create balanced or unbalanced connection.  I used the aftermarket nice twisted cable the owner had supplied.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The large cups made an easy job of mounting them on my fixture and getting good measurements on first try.AKG K712 Pro MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:Compliance with our target is only in the 200 to 500 Hz (I calibrate to 420 Hz).  Very hard to imagine what they were thinking in the response between 500 Hz and 5 kHz.  There is massive shortfall.  We also have the usual bass droop.Relative response shows that we need very large compensation at 4.5 kHz:Distortion is very good at lower levels:Impedance at 1 kHz is same as advertised but is variable:Bass tuning is at 100 Hz and hence the reason response drops below that.They are not very sensitive so you definitely need a headphone amp:Group delay is reasonable in balance:AKG K712 Pro Listening Tests and EqualizationI only listened for a minute before reaching for EQ.  It sounded very closed and improper to me out of box.  EQ development is a bit challenging due to troughs not matching the shape of a parametric filter.  Still, I lucked out and with just three filters massively improved the response:High level of filter amplitude causes easy clipping so I had to pull the overall levels down which means you need even more drive from your amplifier.  I also could not push the bass enough as distortion would set in.  As is, deep bass was good with EQ.I really enjoyed the spatial qualities that equalization brought to these large drivers/cups.  Turning off the EQ made this collapse.  As usual, this is caused by lack of energy in the 2 to 5 kHz without EQ.ConclusionsI was very surprised at the response of this headphone.  I looked up the announcement data and it was 2013. I think Harman had already performed its headphone research by then.  So I have to think the AKG folks were not on board with it in development of K712 Pro as it doesn't remotely comply with their preference curve.  And if any headphone needs to comply with that standard is the K712.  It is impossible to make a case that you want to filter out all the music spectrum in 1.3 and 3.4 kHz!I can't recommend the K712 Pro without EQ.  With EQ, I am not super happy with deep bass response but spatial qualities are good enough to push me to put it on my recommended list.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member.  I can't find the price on it.  If someone knows, please post and I will udpate the review.I must say, I like the look of this headphone.  It is both serious and playful:The giant cups are comfortable and the headphone itself is light for its size at 300 grams:Inside cup dimensions are 66 by 23 mm (diameter x depth).  Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The large cups made an easy job of mounting them on my fixture and getting good measurements on first try.Drop AKG K7XX ohm MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements: As we see the only area that more or less hits our target is 100 to 500 Hz and then again above 8 kHz.  Everywhere else there is a shortfall.  We can see the differential better for the purposes of equalization:The big news is in distortion:Ouch, ouch, OUCH!  If you are going to have distortion, please don't have it where our hearing is most sensitive in the 2 to 5 kHz.  Unfortunately that is the area of frequency response we need to boost as well.  Let's pray ""measurements don't tell the story"" here or we are toast.Group delay is fuzzy across the full spectrum which I had not seen before:Impedance is pretty constant and on the low side:Sensitivity is slightly worse than average:Drop AKG K7XX Red Edition Listening Tests and EqualizationInstant impression was dull tonality so out came the EQ tools and quick:Bass boost worked very well.  As did the the other two boosts until I listened a bit more to my reference vocal tracks.  At times, I started to clearly here a secondary distorted version of the female vocals.  Turning off the filter in pink reduced most of it.  I originally had it at 1.3 kHz and at higher amplitude.  With that setting the headphone sounded great at times, and horrible because of distortion other times.  I adjusted the levels of that filter down and shifted it to 1 kHz.  Added that other notch.  It reduced the magnitude of the distortion some but still very problematic.  Once you heard it, you also couldn't ""unhear"" it.Shame the distortion is so bad as spatial qualities were pretty good (B+).ConclusionsThe tonality of the AKG K7XX is wrong out of the box. This is the case for many headphones but what was rather unique here was severe distortion in the 1 to 2 kHz.  This stops you from correcting the response in that all important region.  Even without correction, the sound is not quite right as distortion is high even before you boost it.  This is a clear defect in design which should have been caught and fixed.   Maybe there was too much cost pressure from Drop and they reached for the cheapest drivers they had; I don't know.  What I do know is that they screwed up a headphone that otherwise could have performed very well with equalization.  And be comfortable to boot.I can't recommend the Drop AKG K7XX with or without equalization.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

The main issue however is the recession between 500 Hz and 3 kHz.  It has an odd shape so hard to fix with a filter or two.  Here is a the relative response for purposes of developing said EQ:I was disappointed with how fast bass distortion escalated up with level:The rising distortions are unfortunately where we need frequency boosts with EQ so they are going to be more audible.Group delay just confirms the dip on bass and not revealing of much else:Impedance is high and varies by a ratio of two:Sensitivity is below average but not too bad:Headphone Listening and EqualizationOut of box experience is decent due to adequate amount of bass.  But it is unexciting and closed due to droop in energy between 500 and 3 kHz.  So I brought out the EQ tool:Alas, On the first track I listened to, I got screeching highs and crackling.  I decided to add the two high frequency filters but that was not it.  The problem was as I mentioned, the boost in the 500 Hz to 2 kHz.  It is a much needed correction but with the right track, it can sound terrible especially at higher levels.I originally had the bass boost higher to match the measurements.  While again that sounded good on some music, on others, it caused terrible distortion with drivers almost modulating the sound.  At the levels I have it, it seemed to work across most music.At first I was going to ditch the EQ due to distortion but it really lifts the performance of this headphone.  Spatial effects come to their own and overall fidelity is quite nice.ConclusionsIf there is a norm in my headphone reviews, it is the sound being near terrible without EQ, and being good to great with.  Here, that is not the case.  Without EQ the sound is tolerable.  With EQ it gets much better but then distortion comes to haunt you and haunt you big time depending on your music spectrum and how loud you listen.I can't recommend the Beyerdynamic Amiron Home with or without EQ for reasons mentioned.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

From then on, the envelop exceeds our preference curve fair bit so could sound bright.  Bass response is better than many that droop but it is still deficient compared to out preference curve (dashed blue).I noticed that kink in the response around 80 Hz.  So I manually stepped the frequency and it completely corresponded with vibrations/resonances of each cup which travelled up to the headband.  It persists for good rage up to a few hundred hertz.In relative terms, the response is above average:I was hoping for less bass distortion given the massive drivers but still good:One thing I didn't like was the peaking around 4.2 kHz which also sucks out the frequency response.  So something untoward is happening there.  We will see more evidence of this when we look at our impedance curve:You can barely see some variations there.  If I zoom in, we can see the issues quite clearly:Sensitivity is a bit less than average:Group delay is messy and also shows some of the resonances:Hifiman Arya Listening Tests and EqualizationI always start with my female vocals and it did not take more than a few seconds for the higher frequency boost/resonances to bother me.  It extracts every bit of zinginess (yes, technical term) out of the female voices making it hard for me to listen.  Mind you, it is not an overly elevated response like we get out of some headphones and can come across as ""more detail"" but it is wrong.  Outside of this, the sound is actually decent and good.  But this is not our standard.  We want excellence so I went after correcting the response with EQ in my Roon player:Transformation was incredible.  Some of the easiest EQ jobs with great improvement.  Once in place, the tonality was excellent as was the spatial capabilities.  You almost felt like the band was miniaturized and your head was placed inside it!  Kind of neat the way everything separated to the sides and back of my head (I never get forward projection).  Remind me of when I reviewed the Sennheiser HD800s. FYI my RME ADI-2 DAC V2 had no trouble driving it to ear deafening levels.ConclusionsThe Arya is a comfortable headphone and out of box has good tonality but the highs got to me.  So need a bit of EQ to bring out its excellence in enjoyable sound that requires such large drivers often to deliver.  And deliver it does.I can't recommend the Hifiman Arya out of the box.  With EQ however, it becomes a very good performer and one that I can easily recommend.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I am not sure if they were part of the original design and not used when the pads were swapped or what.  No, I am not going to measure this headphone twice.

Besides the bass roll off we also have shortfall in the critical region of 1 to 2 kHz which establishes how ""open"" a headphone sounds.  There is also some lack of treble energy around 4 to 5 kHz with a bit of peaking around 8 kHz.  Overall I expect this headphone to sound quite ""unexciting.""  But we shall see.  Here is the deviation from our target:Deviation from target response is one thing but what's up with this?Group delay indicates some interference pattern but that is common:Sensitivity is a bit below average:Impedance is stated at 55 ohm but it rises to three times as much in lower frequencies, and double that at highest:AKG K240 Listening Tests  and EqualizationI could not listen to the stock sound of this headphone for more than a few seconds.  It is deeply compressed and dull sounding with a bit of ting once in a one.  Equalization is absolutely mandatory for good sound.  I developed one quickly by eye.  A more proper one requires some automation or more work:This gave the headphone much more life with better bass, mid-range and treble response.Spatial qualities were non-existent and didn't develop with EQ but the sound was more open.ConclusionsPlease pardon me for being crude but if I had to listen to these headphones without EQ, I would give up on being an audiophile!  None of my reference tracks sounded exciting with this headphone and many of these tracks are picked because they tend to sound good on many gear!

It was sent to me by the company and costs US $399 on Amazon including Prime shipping.Having tested higher up models in Audeze lines, it is kind of shocking to see such a small headphone from them:The cups are naturally small at 68x36mm and 22 mm deep (symmetrical).  Weight is quite low which contributes to their comfort:There is some kind of ticking of the plastic I hear when I am moving my head.  The supplied cable is stiff so must be exerting enough pressure on the cups to make them move or something.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was surprisingly easy despite the small cups.Audeze LCD-1 MeasurementsAs usual we start with the headphone frequency response as comparison to our preference curve:This is a bit better than some of the other Audeze headphones but typical of the ones I have tested, there is deficiency in the upper and lower frequency range.  This is liable to take away a lot of enjoyment as bass is a big part of listener preference in research (up to 30%).  Upper frequency depression robs the headphone from ever important spatial qualities even if one ignores the tonal contribution.For EQ purposes, subtracting our response from preference gives us a good guide:Fortunately distortion is generally very low:The sharp spikes between 1 and 3 kHz are unfortunate though.  Their narrow width indicates some kind of resonance in the most sensitive part of our hearing.Group delay shows messiness in the 1 to 3 kHz as well so perhaps resonances are mixing with direct sound:Impedance is flat as it normally is in planar magnetic headphones:Impedance is quite low as noted.  Sensitive is below average so you should use a headphone amplifier with it:Audeze LCD-1 Listening Tests and EqualizationThe sound out of box was boring and depressed.  EQ tools were highly effective although developing the right shape filters was a bit challenging:I used dual filters in upper frequencies to better shape the rising edge.  I did the same initially for bass but found it less critical and deleted it.  So at the core, we only need three filters but have five for better matching.Once there, the LCD-1 ""woke up"" presenting impressive bass response with much more open and pleasant sound in the upper frequencies.  I could turn up the level good bit before the mid to high frequencies started to get distorted.Spatial qualities post EQ are ""OK.""  They were non-existent before EQ.ConclusionsThe Audeze LCD-1 falls short in the objective frequency response measurements.  Subjective listening confirmed the same in a sound that is dull, and lacking deep bass.  Equalization works well to fix these deficiencies.  Some mid-level distortion keeps you from turning the volume to max although that is probably a good thing for your hearing health!I can recommend the Audeze LCD-1 with EQ.  Without, it is a strong pass for me.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,099.Member sent me three pairs of pad for them but they all look the same and neither he, nor I know if these are stock ones or not.  Looking at the pictures online, they look similar to the OEM ones. As a woodworker, I very much admire the figured wood used for the cups:This looks like zebra wood to me.  Company references different wood species in different pages so not sure exactly what it is.  Note that fair amount of sound escapes the vents so don't assume these are ""closed headphones"" in the classical sense.Headphones this big are naturally on the heavy side with the Atticus clocking at 500 grams:The large cups are very comfortable though and so I did not find them tiring in the few hours I wore them.  Cup inside dimensions are 75x54x25 mm (height, width, depth).Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitting these headphones on the fixture was a challenge with fair bit of differential between left and right channels and overall variability. The asymmetrical cups cause pressure to be less on the thin side which may be responsible for (slight) pressure loss.  I played a fair bit with them but could not null out the differences.  Overall response shape was pretty much the same though so I have confidence in the directionality of the measurements.ZMF Atticus MeasurementsAs usual we start with our frequency response: Company advertises these as ""warmer"" sound which clearly seems to refer to boosting of the upper bass frequencies.   They also talk about a bit of zing in the highs which must be the thing that pushes the peak up around 6 kHz.  They don't say anything about the depressed region between 1 and 5 kHz which from my experience, can make the headphone sound clusterphobic and closed.  This is exceedingly common though so I see why it is done.Subtracting our response from the preference curve gives us an easier graph to use for equalizer design:As noted, our response beyond large deviation also has many sudden kinks and changes.  This usually indicates the headphone is changing from pure pistonic response which we can see evidence of in our distortion graph:The bass distortion is quite high but let's remember that we excess bass there which we will take out in EQ.  So the worry is what happens farther out in response especially at 1.8 kHz:This flaw has such a strong effect that it shows up in many places including Group Delay:Even electrical phase (not shown) had it in there.  Shame it was not diagnosed and fixed.Sensitivity is slightly below average:Impedance is quite high at 350+ ohm:So you need a headphone amp/driver that can produce good bit of voltage if you want high volume from Atticus.  ZMF Atticus Listening Tests and EqualizationsThe stock performance of Atticus was not exciting.  Most of my tracks sounded dull and closed in.  So I decided to fix the the mid-frequencies first:I was making progress until I had to stop and deal with the low frequency boominess.  It literally got to me.  It was such a remarkable transformation to throw that large negative gain in that region (pink Band 2).   Nothing like the power of AB testing to see how negative the effect of that artificial boost was.  Without EQ, it seems like a small problem.  Take it out and experience the relief you get and you realize how much of an issue that was.Sub-bass region was not very present so I quickly dialed-in a bit of that with Green filter in band 1.  You need that to put some of the bass response tonality you took out with the dip.Once there, the spatial effects were good (I rate it a ""B"") and combined with excellent power handling, the sound was enjoyable and I used the headphone for listening for a few hours.  Occasionally a mid to high frequency note wouldn't sound quite right which could be due to distortion or faultiness of such ad-hoc subjective evaluation.   So not a perfect transformation but darn near it.  Without EQ, I would not go near this headphone.  With EQ, it becomes so much better.ConclusionsZMF executes the look and feel of the Atticus well.  One appreciates that you are getting something for the amount of money you are spending.  Alas, by company's own statement, what you don't get is neutral response which is key to excellent transformation of fidelity across large amount of content.  Without EQ, vocals can be muffled and sound quite closed in nature.  While I like bass, I like it clean and deep, not just boosting things for the sake of boosting it.Fortunately parametric equalization does wonders for the tonality of Atticus.  It substantially upgrades the sound both on tonality and spatial qualities.   The distortion is partially dealt with by lowering the bass but I remain concerned about mid to high frequency distortion especially at 1.8 kHz which is in such a critical part of audible band.Overall, I can not recommend the ZMF Atticus without EQ.  With EQ, it gets a marginal recommendation.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $600 although I am told it goes on sale for just $200!This is a large and heavy headphone.  The owner sent it with the faux leather pads which made it gigantic width wise. With velour pads, it is much more manageable and it initially fit well on my head.  After a few minutes though, the headband started to dig into my head so not sure I could wear it for more than half hour to an hour.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was relative easy but there was an issue as you see below.Monoprice Monolith M1570C MeasurementsI started the measurements with the faux leather pads.  That unfortunately has a deep hole right at the frequency that I calibrate to 94 dBSPL.  It looked very odd that way so I broke my normal rule and brought the overall level to get compliance elsewhere:The graph is very rough which typically indicates resonances (more on this later).  I decided to switch to Velour pads which is shown in dashed brown.  FYI, swapping pads was a royal pain as you have to insert a flexible lip into a very narrow slit all around the cup. Good thing I don't curse as there would have been plenty of that otherwise!Anyway, the velour pad seemed more workable to me so let's go with that from here on:At least now we are just short of bass and midrange as opposed to the uneven response of leatherette.  Here is our relative curve for the much needed equalization:Fortunately distortion is extremely low, sans some resonances:The resonances were milder with the leather pad which may indicate it is the case resonance.Group delay has a number of pronounced discontinuities which is likely partially generated by above resonances:Impedance is relative low and flat as is typically the case with planar magnetic headphones:Sensitivity is below average so you need some amplification:Monoprice M1570C Listening Tests and EQImmediate impression was: ""where is the bass?""  So out came the EQ:As you see, I just tried to compensate for lack of bass and midrange. Due to high amount of bass boost, you have to allow a lot of headroom. Above was good enough for my test tracks which includes some with very deep subbass.  You lose fair bit of headroom because of this so best to have a powerful headphone amplifier. My RME ADI-2 Pro drove it with ease though.With EQ, we now have very good bass with nice fidelity.  Spatial qualities were also very good and pleasing in the way instruments were separated around my ears.  I thought at times the highs were a bit unpleasant but it could be me being biased by the measurements. I tried a couple of sharp filters where the resonances are but that changed tonality too much to conclude that distortion was being reduced.ConclusionsThe Monoprice M1570C seems like a ""phoned in"" design to me. There is clearly no performance target as far as tonality.  Likely specs were given at high level of manufacturer in far east and out come a heavy headphone with very odd frequency response. The saving grace is very low distortion courtesy of large drivers allowing EQ to correct many of its ills.  If it does indeed go on sale for $200, and you can tolerate its weight, it may not be a bad option.I can't recommend the Monoprice Monolith M1570C as is.  With strong EQ, it does wake up and produce good fidelity.  So with that, I can recommend it especially at at the $200 price point.  Just don't try to change the pads if you are not in perfectly calm mood.....-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $170.I was taken aback by how light these headphones are.  You can see it in this table relative to most of the others I have tested:This doesn't give them feeling of luxury but sure are comfortable to wear given the large cups that are 73mm x 45mm.  Drivers are mounted at an angle and have a maximum depth of 28 mm.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The cups fit my fixture's artificial ears easily.Sennheiser HD560S MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:This is very close compliance with our target response across a broad region which means it should not need to have equalization to sound good.  That said, it does lack deep bass energy although not as much as some of the other Sennheiser headphones.  And there is a bit of excess energy above 4 kHz. Combined, there may be a tad extra brightness to the sound.Here is the relative response for purpose of developing EQ filters:High frequency distortion is extremely low but bass distortion rapidly rises with level:As noted, we are deficient in bass amplitude so when we boost it, you are looking at curves above the blue one.  How much will be determined in listening tests.Here is the absolute distortion level:Group delay shows the typical messiness in many headphones in lower treble and some spikes that serve as warning sign as far as trying to equalize the response at those frequencies:Impedance is on the medium side and variable:That should let you drive them better than the higher impedance Sennheisers like HD650 as the amplifier doesn't need as much output voltage.  Still, some power is good as sensitivity is below average:Sennheiser HD560S Listening Tests and EqualizationWhat you see (in measurements) is what you get.  The HD560S is immanently usable without equalization.  Yes, they are a bit bright but not annoyingly so at all.  But we can improve on that with equalization by simply following our frequency response deviation graph:Working from right, the two filters there are small but are enough to take the edge away from the highs.  But then the sound can be a bit dull so I boosted the range with broad filter at 2580 Hz which improved spatial qualities.  On female vocal, the voices now stood out more instead of being a bit sharp.We then get to the pair of filters I use for bass to give a ramped increase to match the frequency response.  This added some nice warmness and of course, a lot more bass.  Alas, it is only usable at low to medium levels.  Above that I could hear the left headphone clicking and eventually both drivers distorting.  For everyday listening though, there was plenty of volume so I would go with these filters if you are not liable to crank up content with sub-bass response.I did a final AB between EQ and no EQ and difference is small, once again proving the statement I made at the outset that EQ is not mandatory.ConclusionsIt is great to see another Sennheiser headphone nearly matching our target response and be easy to EQ.  Combined with the light weight and low price, the HD560S made me happier after I tested it.    Its only weakness is high distortion in low frequencies which limits how much you can EQ that region and at what volume level.I am going to recommend the HD560S as is and more so with EQ.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,400.The 820 is a very large headphone but feels like and fits well on my head:It comes with two different length cables, both of which are quite thick and microphonic.  They seem strong enough to hang yourself from them!The 820 weighs 409 grams and has internal cup dimensions of 62, 80 and 30 (width, height, depth).  The driver is angled so the other side is less deep.The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.Usually I calibrate the loudness relative to 425 Hz.  At this frequency the two channels were wildly out of sync as you will see later so I opted for 1 kHz instead.  This can change the filter set you create but net results is the same.As you see below, the channels did not match even though Sennheiser has a reputation of good matching between drivers.  Despite the large cups, slight changes would vary the levels fair bit and at any rate,  I could not get the two to match in 15 minutes or so I spent on it.Sennheiser HD 820 MeasurementsThere is nothing more important than frequency response of a headphone as each is seemingly different and that difference leaves a very distinct character: At first glance this looks pretty ugly.  We have a dip around 60 Hz and then a giant hump followed with a dip.   Thankfully in the all important range of 1 to 3 kHz, we have excellent tracking.  Note that if you are comparing my measurements to others, they are syncing the preference point at a different spot so wind up showing this compliance differently.  We also have a rather broad notch between 3 and 5 kHz.Subtracting the response from our preference curve gives us:I have marked two points of interest there.  Let's look at the distortion percentage:Starting to the right, it is interesting that we have a distortion in the same 3 to 5 kHz range that there is a dip in the driver response.  All the way to the left, there seems to be a sudden rise in distortion at the same dip in bass frequency but distortion level actually doesn't change:THD% is a ratio of level to distortion so when the level dropped due to that dip, it artificially created a spike in THD%.  Overall, this is a low distortion headphone other than 3 to 5 kHz where our hearing is most sensitive.  Group delay is rather clean other than indicating once again something is wrong around 60 Hz and then where that hump is:We had a running theory that headphones with good spatial effects would have a messy group delay in the lower treble area.  Such is not the case here at all.Impedance is variable and can get quite high:So you want to pay attention to how high a voltage a headphone amp produces.  Typical phone output is usually low in that department making the 820 not a great fit for them.   Efficiency is slightly below average which makes this a worse situation:Sennheiser HD 820 Headphone Listening TestsOne look at the frequency response and you think the 820 is going to sound strange but it does not.  The good sub-bass response means there is healthy response there.  Combined with good spatial qualities, you have fair amount of tail wind behind you to like the sound of the headphone.  Still, one is forced to try to correct the response errors to see how much better it can get with equalization:The three left filters should be self-explanatory and are inverse of the frequency response errors (more or less).  Let me put a pin in the right shelf for now.With this new filter, I not only found the sound more correct, but also more detailed and cleaner.  With or without the filters though, I found an emphasis in high frequencies resonances of female vocals.  Not lisping mind you.  But a bit of extra zing.  I went back and listened with my AKG K371 and the same thing was there but not nearly as emphasizes.  This bothered me a bit without EQ.  With equalization in the 3 to 5 kHz to make up that dip, the effect was hugely magnified and perhaps distorted.  I resorted to putting that shelving filter on the right to make up for it but it was no help.  I tried many techniques to find the cause of this issue but had to give up and not put that correction in there.  It is a shame as filling in that hole improved the spatial effects.  Anyway, with what you see above, this was a very comfortable headphone to wear, with decent amount of isolation and good spatial effects.  I am listening to them as I type this.ConclusionsHard to imagine what was behind the motivation to produce a headphone with this kind of objective frequency response.  Then again, I appreciated the deep bass response out of the box.  Pulling down that hump seemingly reduced distortion anyway so I did not mind it.  The 3 to 5 kHz remains a puzzle that I could not solve.  Usually I get to the bottom of the ""story"" behind a headphone by the time I am done but here, I declare defeat and leave it at that.  Overall, based on post EQ and subjective results, I can recommend the Sennheiser HD 820.  Mind you, I personally would not at all pay $2,400 for it.  Performance ratings are price independent for the most part so there you are.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I purchase mine back in 2017.  It costs US $400 with free shipping as of this writing from Amazon.  My sample is near new because I don't use it everyday (due to high noise level, I have to wear closed back headphones).The HD650 feels rather plastically although it has been robust in the face my rough handling at times:Here is a close shot of the driver in mine just in case there are variations in production that are visible such:My history with this class of Sennheiser headphones goes back to 1999 or so.  We (my team at Microsoft) had just developed our audio codec and wanted the labels to use it for online music distribution.  I was invited to a number of major music labels (Sony, Warner, Universal, etc.) for codec shootouts.  I asked around and ""the"" headphones of the time at the labels was the Sennheiser HD series (560?) , Stax and Sony MDRV-6 (?).  I promptly bought all and used them all the time in testing our codecs.  Happy to say we did well with all the major labels and got our codec approved for distribution.I donated my old Sennheiser to my son years ago and don't know where it is.  But somehow I remember the velour pads to be softer and more luxurious than the current set which I find a bit stiff.Anyway, being one of the most popular headphones out there, the HD650 has been reviewed to death.  The purpose here then is to not provide yet another review but provide a good baseline for our measurements and testing of other headphones since so many people are familiar with it.The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.  Calibration level is 94 dBSPL @ 425 Hz.Sennheiser HD650 MeasurementsThere is nothing more important than frequency response of the headphone as each is seemingly different and that difference leaves a very distinct character:Focusing on 100 Hz to 7000 Hz, we see that the response of the HD650 comes very close to our reference curve in dashed blue.  This is interesting since the HD650 predates the research that led to the blue preference curve.  No wonder then that HD650 is so popular.Below 100 Hz, we fall short and short a lot when it comes to bass and sub bass region.  This is likely to make the headphone sound colder and perhaps brighter.Showing the difference between the preference curve and left channel we get:You can see the shortfall in bass and matching above that much better now.  Note that above a few Kilohertz, there are reflections and other inaccuracies so care must be taken in interpreting that region.  So don't be alarm about the large variations reaching 10 kHz and above.We can take a quick look at the ""Group delay"" and see the warning signs of where to be careful about:Those massive phase variations indicated by sharp dips or peaks indicate mixing of reflections usually which can create troughs in the frequency response.There is some kind of resonance between 200 and 300 Hz which we can (barely) see in the frequency response as well.Distortion measurement shows that there is excessive amount of compared to the (few) headphones we have measured in bass region:Looking at this as absolute level we get:The HD650 has variable and high impedance:The high impedance means that it likes to have ""high"" drive voltage (at least 2 volts in my experience).  The variable impedance means that if you drive it with a headphone amplifier with high impedance, e.g. a tube amplifier, it will modify its frequency response. That modification may be to your liking, or not.  Better rely on equalization as I will show shortly instead of a haphazard one using a tube amp.Sennheiser HD650 Listening Tests and EqualizationThe HD650 sounds like it measures.  That is, it has a very good sound and tonality out of the box -- better than any other headphone I have tested.  No wonder that I am often surprised how good it is when I go back to testing it for a few seconds after using another for a long time.   You can however do much, much better with just a bit of equalization:Dual shelf filters work together to lift the bass up.  There is a shortfall around 8 kHz.  And some resonance peaking around 13 kHz that needed to be knocked off.  I tried other filters but their effect was not conclusive.  This set transforms the HD650 into a superb sounding headphone.  I am listening to it right now and can't put it down!  Try this wonderful clip from Nils Frahm for example (track #2):The Tidal version is far better but even the youtube one sounds wonderful.  Let it keep laying and it lays very good low frequency tones which the HD650 reproduces with little difficulty.  Its reproduction with equalization is better than vast majority of speakers in rooms.Where is not so good is the spatial qualities.  There is a nice open circle that the sound sources emanate from.  It starts from your ears and circles forward.  There is no sensation of space beyond that.  Nor that nice layering that the Sennheiser HD800S which I recently reviewed brings to the table.  I always get a feeling of the sound closing up in space when I wear the HD650 after wearing others.If you are wondering about effect of equalization on distortion, here it is:Edit: the original measurement was in error.  This is an updated one with slightly more optimization than distortion graph earlier.  Will sync the two later.As expected, my large increase in bass level naturally increases the distortion there.  But listen to this: without EQ you hardly hear those notes down in 20 to 30 Hz.  No sense in having a clean signal you can't perceive!  With equalization, those notes now play as if you have 20 Hz to 20 kHz reference quality speaker over your head.  Don't miss on this opportunity to hear the full spectrum of the recording.As noted on the graph, extra distortion in bass is not always perceived as such.  Instead, harmonics actually help fill out the bass region giving one the impression of more bass, not necessarily more distortion.ConclusionsThere are a lot of sexier headphones out there than this old design but the HD650 not only holds its own still but with equalization produces an excellent high fidelity experience.  If you are anti-equalization, you can still enjoy a lot of what this headphone has to offer.Happy to recommend the Sennheiser HD650 headphone.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

They are on kind loan from a member and cost US $249.Let's start with the China version. It is lightweight and doesn't impart feeling of a premium product.  The large cups make them comfortable to wear though.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results.

Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!The K701 has a self-adjusting mechanism which makes it hard to put high pressure on the test fixture. There was fair amount of variability in how I seated the unit. AKG K701 MK II Chinese MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:No matter what I did, I could not get the weak channel to match the other.  What is there doesn't seem too bad.  Here is our relative frequency response for purposes of EQ filter development:The highly irregular shape combined with difficulty of measuring this headphone means an exact EQ is going to be hard to develop.  But I am sure we can improve on the stock sound.I was disappointed in distortion measurements:That spike at 2 kHz is where our hearing is very sensitive.  Its narrow width though indicates it is likely a resonance.  Group delay confirms that a secondary resonance (of the case?) at the same frequency as above:Impedance was on the low to medium side:Sensitivity is below average but not crazy so:AKG K701 Austrian Made MeasurementsLet's start with a shot of the unit itself:Notice that the headband has bubbles in it which I found more comfortable.  And the cup has the designation of ""Made in Austria).  Otherwise they two feel the same.Channel matching here was actually worse than the Chinese version:That is whopping 5 dB difference extending to almost 1 kHz!  It may be measurement error or fitment but still, we don't see large variations like this often.Comparing the Chinese to Austrian we get:Given the degree of accuracy we have in measurements, I say that they are ""the same.""  Where they are not the same is in distortion measurements:So looks like there are minor variations in the mechanical aspects of the headphone that causes resonances at different frequencies.  Overall, I prefer the Austrian one (right above).Group delay now looks better:AKG K701 Listening Tests and EqualizationI did my listening tests and EQ using the Austrian one.  Out of the box response is not offensive.  It seems a bit upper bass boosted and the rest sounds kind of ordinary.  Fixing the response errors wakes up the sound nicely:Bass distortion was not audible until you cranked it up. Then it would crackle a bit and progressively get worse.  But it never pops or make you scared that something bad is going to happen.With EQ, I could sit back and enjoy the sound and take advantage of the comfort of the unit.ConclusionsCommon between these two AKG headphones is rather complex response error and resonances.  EQ helps with the former to create much better sound.  Our measurements and headphone variations are too large to say convincingly that one version is worse than the other.  Taken at face value, I would say the Austrian one is a bit better in distortion department.  But sadly had more channel variation.I can't recommend either version of AKG K701 without EQ.  With EQ, they are fine.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Audio-Technica ATH-R70x MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:I was pleased to see the good compliance with our target in broad region between 100 Hz and 4 kHz.  This should provide good bit of neutrality.  Bass is obviously lacking and we have a trough around 4.3 kHz.Relative response shows the same:Low frequency distortion was quite high:Given the fact that we need to boost the bass, we likely won't have a good combination at higher volumes.  Speaking of volume, this is the highest impedance headphone I have measured:Combined with below average sensitivity means you better have a good headphone amplifier with high voltage drive:Group delay was messy in multiple regions: Audio-Technica ATH-R70x Listening TestsOut of the box fidelity was good as measurements indicate.  It is not super exciting due to lack of deep bass and highs which collapse spatial effects.  Still, it is more than usable and so a good fit for people who don't have EQ capabilities around.  Just two filters are necessary to get a substantial boost in performance:With the second filter, spatial quality became above average which was nice to have.  Alas the bass boost caused static sounds at higher volume levels.  Normal listening is fine but just know that you don't have much headroom here.ConclusionsThe $300 price range is quite crowded with many headphones with likes of Sennheiser and Hifiman dominating.  From fidelity point of view, I like them better.  And they are also more comfortable for me to wear.

Add a bit of salt and pepper in the form of bass boost and lower treble energy and you are in business with a very high fidelity headphone.  That it comes at such a low cost is a huge bonus, making the HE400SE one of my best picks for a bargain headphone.I am happy to recommend the Hifiman HE400SE.P.S.  Linsoul listing says ""V2.""  I am not sure if there is a V2 and if there is, that is what I have.

850,039ce7eb-8bfe-4ca9-a1b5-0bcbbf182bd5,Over Ear,Dan Clark Audio (MrSpeakers),AEON 2 Noire,353.0,7/1/23,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/dan-clark-audio-aeon-2-noire-review.46055/,13.0,"This is a review, listening test and measurements of the Dan Clark Audio (DCA) AEON 2 Noire Planar Magnetic closed back headphone. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $850.As soon as you touch and attempt to pick up the headphone, it immediately conveys a feeling of luxury with butter soft pads contrasting against the glossy finish. When I took off my everyday Dan Clark Stealth and put on the Noire, I felt like I had nothing on my head! It is that much lighter and so much more comfortable (although I wear my Stealth for hours).Fitment on the GRAS measurement fixture was instant requiring almost no effort including great channel matching.DCA AEON 2 Noire MeasurementsWe start with our usual frequency response measurement:I speaking to Dan, he tens to think that hump around 100 Hz is desirable.   We saw it in the Expanse headphone review.   We do have some shortfall in the 2 to 4 kHz and some peaking past that.  From my experience, such a deficiencies robs you of spatial qualities.  Again, I think Dan thinks this brings some ""breathiness"" to vocals. In all, I can see his signature on this headphone, the more neutral response on the much more expensive headphones from him notwithstanding.  The rough shape of the graph in the 2 to 8 kHz makes quick and dirty EQ more difficult:EDIT: my testing was without any of the pads (filters) provided by the company.  See these measurements for impact of that: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...-audio-aeon-2-noire-review.46055/post-1643697Distortion is more than I am used to seeing in DAC headphones but since we have plenty of bass, it is of less concern:Group delay is clean above bass indicating lack of internal reflections:Impedance is very low and flat which means your headphone amp better have good current delivery:Combined with half the sensitive of the median headphone, I think a headphone amplifier is mandatory:My RME ADI-2 Pro was just good enough.  I could crank it to max volume at +6 dB to get loud but then I had no headroom left (i.e. ability to drive the headphone to clipping).DCA AEON 2 Noire Listening Tests and EqualizationThe first impression was actually good.  There was a warm quality to the sound courtesy of good amount of bass.  I didn't listen long though as I wanted to see the effect of EQ:I started with Band 1 filter.  You would think reducing bass would result in the amp being less warm. The effect paradoxically was the opposite!  The highs were reduced a bit.  I suspect what was happening was the reduction of harmonic distortion that was bleeding into the higher frequencies.  I then dialed in filter 2.  In AB testing against no EQ, it was not clear in my mind which would be better.  So I pulled down the one peak, added more to lower frequencies and put that shelving filter.  Now we are talking!    The sound opened up and was no longer closed and bassy.  On my reference tracks, I was amazed at the level of fidelity.  Detail was superb now and of course, that wonderful bass was there to complement those highs.  I wanted to keep listening but had to stop to take a picture of the headphone.Putting my Stealth back on, it was a more balanced experience with less hyped up lower treble.  So perhaps I crave more in that area as reflected in my EQ choice above.  What can I say.    Need to try that with the Stealth...ConclusionsThe Aeron 2 Noire brings expected bass response (and a bit more) but trades some loss of energy in lower treble with some peaking in upper frequencies.  EQ by eye is difficult but with luck or skill, I arrived at a setting that produces just marvelous fidelity to my ear.  I can imagine many being happy with the stock tuning which made it hard for me to rate it without EQ.  With EQ though, it matches my taste perfectly.  Combine that with its high level of comfort and luxury, and you have a winner there.I am not going to recommend the DAC Aeron 2 Noire without EQ strictly based on my personal taste.  With EQ, it more than delights me and becomes a recommendation.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member.  This is discontinued but I think the cost was $1049 when available.This is the flagship model from Beyerdynamic but to me, it doesn't look it:The T1 feels light and is generally comfortable.  It does pinch the bottom of my ear though so pay attention to these measurements to make sure it won't yours:The included split, dual 3.5mm stereo jacks seems sturdy and long enough for mountain climbing!  It tangled everywhere.  Fortunately since it is removable you could make your own one.  While you are at it, make it balanced to take advantage of higher power in some headphone amps with this type of output.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Beyerdynamic T1 V2 MeasurementsLet's start with frequency response of T1 and comparison to our preference target to figure out tonality of the headphone:Story here is quite simple as noted on the graph.  Like many headphones, bass response drops below 100 Hz so sub-bass response is going to be poor.  We then get good alignment until we reach 1 kHz or so where we have good bit of deficit.  This is bad as I consider this region ""audiophile life of music!""  Without it, female vocals feel recessed and lack sparkle.  Spatial effects also suffer although the angled drivers and open back of this headphone may remedy that partially.  Thankfully when it comes to high frequency accentuation, we only have one resonance peak around 8 kHz so the sound should not be bright across all content.We can subtract the two curves and see the relative response telling the same story:We have 8 dB of droop and 8 dB of peaking!I am not happy with the amount of distortion the T1 produced especially for a ""flagship"" headphone:Sure, we get low frequency distortion often but here that also spreads to 100 Hz plus.  And doesn't stay quiet above that either.Group delay shows some messiness where we are showing distortion above indicating driver not responding well:The T1 is stated to have 600 ohm impedance which is already high.  Turns out that the real impedance can be much worse:In bass frequencies where we have most energy in music, impedance rises even higher to whopping 910 ohm!  This means you want a headphone drive/amplifier that does well with high impedance, i.e. produces high voltage.  This rules out most portable solutions such as phones and tablets.  So even though sensitivity is not too crazy:You still need to have very good drive for this headphone.  I noticed that the third generation one is rated at 32 ohm so they seem to have learned their lesson here.Beyerdynamic T1 V2 Headphone Listening and EqualizationAs I had predicted, general experience was decent with this headphone.  The sound was not exciting but nor was it annoying unlike the DT990 I recently reviewed.  I thought then it would be a walk in the park to boost the lows and mid-frequencies and pull down that dip with EQ:The results were indeed quite positive.  The sound now had that sparkle I look for together with better bass response.  A few tracks into testing though and boom, I hit on this same warbling distortion I experienced with the DT990.  This was on a section of vocal.  Shut off EQ and it reduced the amount but it was still there.  Turned the bass EQ on and off and it had large impact on this distortion.  Now I was stuck.  Without bass EQ, the sound was somewhat bright now and of course we didn't have satisfying bass.  With it, three tracks would sound good and all of a sudden I would hear this distortion which would pull me out of music.I tried to tease this out by running different tests such as intermodulation, etc.  While they showed the T1 to have more distortion than some other headphones, it did not show the problem clearly.  So I resorted to listening.  I fed the output of RME ADI-2 DAC to Topping A90 in its high gain mode so that I could really crank up the volume (!).  Once there, I could hear the same distortion whenever there was a rich spectrum of low and high frequencies.  At lowest volumes, it would be barely detectable.  Turn up the volume to medium and you could hear it.  Turn it all the way up and it would become horrendously distorted.  A bit more and it would crackle.  And again, that bass boost would make it much worse.I put in some high pass filters between 70 and 100 Hz and problem was mostly there still.  This tells me that the issue is the distortion above 100 Hz that is most audible.  This is not a full diagnostic (that is up to the manufacturer to figure out) but enough to tell me that you can't save this headphone with EQ.As I was running the distortion tests against some other headphones, I listened to a few seconds to AKG K371 and Ether AEON RT Closed.  Oh what revelation those two headphones were compared to T1.  Beautiful tonality with no sign of the distortion I was chasing above.  That's when I decided the T1 is a failure.ConclusionsI equate German engineering with excellence.  When it comes to headphone design though, we need to go beyond how something is machined and manufactured.  We need ultra low distortion and proper tonality.  This is what an excellent headphone can deliver but unfortunately the Beyerydnamic T1 V2 is absent from the party.  It is too dull without EQ and too distorted with leaving me nowhere to go.  Fine, you believe different tonality but what is the excuse for high distortion in such an expensive headphone?  And you made it hard to drive too so the headphone amp may also contribute to it???I cannot recommend the Beyerdynamic T1 V2.  Hopefully the third-generation version is much better. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $210.I am sure one of the forum historians will tell us but I think this is a 20+ year old design and it shows it. The plastic feel of the cup surrounds doesn't inspire any feeling of luxury. Fortunately it wears light and comfortable with its large cups and average weight:Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the measurement fixture was easy.Beyerdynamic DT-150 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual frequency response measurements:As usual, the target in dashed blue is a good speaker measured in a standardized room (and filtered).  Compared to that, we have good compliance with DT-150 between 300 Hz and 3 kHz.  Deviation outside of that is large though with copious amount of bass/midrange and uneven response above 3 kHz.  Looking at the difference between our target and measured response we get:To get a proper response, we need to pull down everything above 0 dB line, and pull up what is below (with care) using parametric filters.Distortion is bass centric which is good news as we have too much energy there which we will be reducing with EQ:Group delay just shows some messiness around the bass resonance:Impedance is nominally what is stated but varies some:Consider this a ""high impedance"" headphone and focus on a headphone amplifier that can deliver voltage.  On that front, the DT-150 is more power hungry than our average headphone:Combined with high impedance, you will not have much luck driving it with average portable device/phone without an amp.Beyerdyanamic DT150 Listening Tests and EqualizationDue to good mid-frequency response the first impression is not bad.  It is not until you listen a bit more that the bass boominess enters the picture, forcing me to reach for equalization tool:Bass deviation requires a different curve than a single PEQ filter I implemented so what is there is not exact.  At first I just went with that and let the extra energy in deep bass be but that was too much so I put in a shelving filter there.  I then filled a hole and brought down the higher frequencies.  I don't EQ above 8 to 10 kHz but if you are young, you may need to pull them down as the peaks indicate excess energy. With all the filters in place, the sound became nice and open. My reference tracks were now enjoyable to listen to.  Note that I did not get much of any spatial effects, none that jumped out at me anyway.  So the improvement is limited to tonality here.ConclusionsVast majority of headphones I measure have bass deficiency.  So I am always surprised when I see the opposite as in the DT-150 here.  Fortunately it is a ""good problem to have"" with EQ being quite effective.  If you can implement equalization, then the tonality can be salvaged.  What you do about the look and the feel of the product, I don't know.Overall, I am not going to recommend the Beyerdynamic DT-150.  You can pick up a lot of modern headphones at similar prices that sound excellent and feel great.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

I think it is exclusive to Adorama (?) and costs US $899 but goes on sale for $260 or something like it.The look is similar to other Hifiman headphones:Comfort was good with about average weight:Cups are symmetrical and round with diameter of 61mm and depth of 23mm.The included cable is short and rather stiff, terminated with 3.5mm plugs so easy to replace.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C.

The latter though is more than some others I have tested and is dissipating to see.  It will not only impact tonality but also spatial effects.  But overall not too bad.Relative frequency response graph useful for development of EQ is:Developing EQ should be simple given the shape of shortfalls.Distortion is very low which is nice:Group delay is messy as is usually the case with these headphones:Impedance as usual is flat and low:It does require fair bit of juice to get loud:You definitely need a good headphone amplifier to drive it.Hifiman HE560 V4 Listening Tests and EqualizationWithout equalization the sound is not bad.  It sounds light on its feet due to lack of bass energy.  I turned on my HE400i EQ and it instantly elevated the performance a few notches.  I refined it more for the 560 response and landed with this:Once there, spatial qualities were excellent and overall tonality very good. ConclusionsI honestly can't keep track of why there are so many models in the hifiman lineup.  What is here seems to have been tweaked just a bit in the wrong direction.  Fortunately with low distortion, equalization can compensate.  Once there though, I did not want to listen without it.  So this means you need to have EQ with you in all of your uses which can be inconvenient if you use a platform that doesn't support.Overall, I can't recommend the HE560 V4 at its retail price. Fully discounted it is not bad but there are better choices from the company at even lower costs (HE400SE).  Still equalization does it a lot of good and with it, I can recommend it.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

Company was kind enough to share with me a couple of samples which I have been testing and playing with in the last couple of weeks.  It costs US $3999.The price made me think this was a giant headphone but I was shocked how it was packed in a very small case when folded:Everything is soft touch and buttery smooth as you hold the headphone.  Fit is very comfortable for me and I have no complaints to report.The Stealth headphone uses a special ‚Äúacoustic metamaterial‚Äù is placed after the driver to tune and optimize its performance.:Metamaterial is usually a 3-D construct that has better properties than any solid base material. It can be designed to perform a number of acoustic functions from diffusion (to deal with standing waves for example) to resonances (acting as filters to tune the frequency response). We saw an example of such metamaterial in the KEF LS50 Meta speaker I recently reviewed where it was used to reduce reflections within the enclosure better than any normal acoustic material. The down side is cost which as you can imagine is contributing to the retail cost of Stealth.Stealth weighs 415 grams:The cup is asymmetrical and driver is mounted at a slant.  It has an inside height of 74 mm and width of 50 mm.  Maximum depth is 29 mm.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was somewhat variable. I spent quite a bit of time messing with them and what you see is the best I could get.Dan Clark Stealth MeasurementsSit back and be prepared to be amazed:Yes!  We have the highest compliance to our target curve of any headphone we have ever tested!  The bit of deviation is dependent on mounting the unit on the fixture.  The only deviation is a small bump between 100 and 160 Hz which company feels is necessary to give balance to the headphone sound.Here is the relative frequency response which gives you a better sense of how close we are to our target:The first sample I received had stunningly low distortion measurements.  Alas, a small tweak had to be made to it which bumped the distortion a bit in low frequencies.  The result is still impressive especially if you look at the level of distortion higher in the range:For kicks, I measured the distortion at 94 dBSPL at 2 kHz and converted it to SINAD.  That produces 81 dB!  It is incredible that a mechanical device is able to produce so little distortion especially when you consider that this value is the sum of the distortion in the headphone plus the measurement microphone and measurement noise.Here is the same in absolute dB:Notice the wide gap below our reference of 40 dB above 100 Hz.  And how it is frequency independent hinting at lack of resonances.  The Stealth is a league of its own here.Group delay is very clean above low bass:Company asked me to measure the impulse response and its fast settling so here it is:Impedance is flat and low as you can expect from this type of technology:You need a beefy headphone amplifier to drive the Stealth:I was fine using my RME ADI-2 DAC so it doesn't have to be crazy power.Dan Clark Stealth Listening TestsI usually measure headphones before listening but this time I was first asked how it sounded so I decided to listen.  That was a mistake as I could not stop listening to them to do the measurements!  This is one of the most transformative experiences I have had in audio!  What an incredibly clean, dynamic sound with absolute correctness in tonality.  Naturally there was no need to apply any EQ.On spatial qualities, it is also excellent which is surprising for a closed back headphone.  The Sennheiser HD800S may be a tad better but I consider what that headphone provides to be artificial, albeit of the rare, nice kind.  Not so with Stealth.  Every bit of spatial quality when it comes to separation of instruments and left and right positioning sound natural and normal like the world's best audio system.ConclusionsBoth objectively and subjectively the Stealth makes a leap forward in headphone sound reproduction and possibly for any audio reproduction.  It is that impressive of a product.  You all know that I don't usually waste a lot of words praising products.  Mostly because I get so many excellent products to test and have my dream stereo that not much impresses me.  But the Stealth did just that.  It changed my outlook on how much better your experience can be listening to these headphones.In some ways the Stealth reminded me of OLED TVs.  The first time you watch them and see the inky blacks and wonderful contrast, you have regret that all that time you didn't get to see what your content really looked like.  Stealth does that for sound reproduction.There is no getting around the high cost of the headphone though.  I grilled the company left and right on why this headphone costs so much and whether the cost could come down.  My wish and hope is that it does come down in price to make it more affordable to more people.   For now, not only is this some you should buy if you can afford it, but if you are an audio company and want to know what best in class, ""correct"" sound reproduction is like, you need to buy this headphone.  You will finally have a true reference for quality and tonality.It is my pleasure to give the highest praise and recommendation I possibly can to Dan Clark Stealth Headphones.P.S.  A condition of sending this headphone to me for review was that it would have to be returned to the company.  It would be a sad, sad day when that happens!Edit: video review just posted:----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
1900,41f58cb4-679b-4b1c-9f77-4dc35b902b5f,Over-Ear,HEDD,HEDDphone,583.0,12/31/20,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/hedd-heddphone-review-headphone.18976/,41.0," HEDD (speaker company) HEDDPhone headphone.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1899.There is no sugar coating the massive size and high weight of HEDD:I wear heavy helmet and protective gear when woodworking on working in the yard so the weight -- at least initially -- was not bothersome.  The wide and supple leather strap helps with that.  The fit is not very tight side to side however and if you rotate your head too quickly the headphones have a lag in following you.  I got used to the whole affair listening for 1+ hour but when I took them off, I could sense slight discomfort in the back bottom of my neck.  Given this, the HEDDphone can't be your everyday listening gear.  You would put it on to listen for a bit and then take it off.EDIT: seems like the leather strap is an aftermarket addition on this headphone.A rather stiff and rope like detachable cables come with it (or at least I think these are the stock cables -- owner sent me some other braided ones):Here you see the main differentiation of this headphone: the driver is the AMT one we are used to seeing as tweeter on speakers but now it has been put to use as a full range unit.  Is it a good idea?  Let's find out by measuring and listening.HEDD HEDDPhone MeasurementsAs usual we start with our all important frequency response graph, shown together with our reference target (dashed blue):Let me first note what is going on with the large variance between left and right channels.  The strap is screwed to the chassis of the headphone using four tiny screws.  As delivered by the owner, it would not get wide enough for me to properly experiment with placement on the gear.  It was close but I needed a hair more.  I looked at adjusting the screws but they seem partially damaged/nicked so I did not want to take a chance of messing with them.  So I played around and got one channel to perform well which is the one in green.  All other attempts at placement produced the red curve for both cups.Back to the measurement, we see quite an uneven and exaggerated response between 100 Hz and 1 kHz.  That peaking between 600 and 800 Hz is quite odd.  Must be some kind of low Q resonance which unfortunately makes it audible.  Above 1 kHz we are actually close to the target. forgetting about the troughs that are usually cancellations caused by reflections.Note that the headphone is quite inefficient requiring nearly 0.6 volts to produce 94 dBSPL at 425 Hz.  Due to sharply declining bass response, you need to crank it up much more than this to get decent sub bass response.I am not happy with the roughness of the response above 500 Hz.  We see a lot of tiny noise-like variations.  Let's look at the distortion graph to see if there are any clues there:  (note: 124 dB should say 114)Wow, what happened here?  Every speaker I have tested and all the headphones so far have highest distortions in low frequencies, shrinking down to very low in higher ones.  The HEDD is the opposite.  Our hearing is most sensitive in 2 to 5 kHz so having highest distortion there doesn't seem to be a good idea.  Note however that the above is a ratio so gets spiky when there are response dips so let's look at the absolute level:Same problem although not nearly as revealing as our previous graph.  My reference of 40 dBSPL is exceeded from 1 kHz to 5 kHz.From glass half-full point of view though, we should be able to push the low frequencies hard with no distortion consequences.Group delay also points to messiness in mid-frequencies although this measurement is not very revealing in general:With the exception that any tall spiked indicate ""non-minimum-phase"" response so you should not attempt to EQ them.  Fortunately they also show up as narrow and deep troughs in frequency response so the Group Delay graph just confirms that.For those of you who want to see ""speaker frequency response"" type graph, here it is:This is a good tool for deciding on equalization.  I usually put the cursor on areas of large deviation and then EQ based on that.  Note that our response has whopping 13 dB variation from reference.  So clearly we are dealing with colorations here.Impedance is essentially constant and rather low at 41 ohm:This means high-impedance tube headphones would not modify the frequency response of this headphone.  However, I doubt that any of them can drive this headphone due to its low sensitivity.  The high impedance in the headphone amp would chew up the power the headphone needs to produce sound.  Best to stay with high performance, high power low impedance headphone amplifier.Headphone Listening TestsMy initial reaction was that the HEDD sounded like a speaker with too much room modes/uneven bass response.  Couldn't tolerate that for long so pulled out the equalization tools in my Roon media player and went after correcting the low to mid frequency errors:The filter at 250 Hz was borderline.  It makes the headphone sound lighter on its feet but some may like the extra bass boost there.Without EQ, I found the HEDD to sound somewhat bright.  With deep bass boost and despite lowering the energy above, the tonal balance improved substantially.  There was now excellent, clean bass together with highs that were more focused.What was remarkable was the improvement in soundstage.  Without EQ, the response was maybe a bit better than a typical headphone with its center of your head response.  With EQ, a larger bubble was created that started at your ears and travelled up 5 or 6 inches with instruments layering separately in that half sphere.  This demonstrates that frequency response has a large role in sound stage even though people think this is a distinct phenomena.  I think this has to do with the fact that lower frequencies tend to be more in mono and hence when they are exaggerated as they were here without EQ, they stepped on spatial cues in higher frequencies.A track that brings out such layering well is the recently released orchestral live album from Sigur R√≥s, Odin‚Äôs Raven Magic and the track Stendur √¶va:At around 3:00 minute, incredibly deep synthesized bass arrives that are barely appreciated without EQ.  With EQ, they make their presence known wonderfully on the HEDD.  My spectrum analyzer on the RME ADI-2 shoots way up from 25 Hz up.About that high distortion in mid-frequencies, could I hear them?  A number of times I thought the highs were not as clear as I remembered in the past but really, this is a very unreliable subjective test.  I would need to do a proper AB test to know for sure.  So for now, I would say it is not a barrier to enjoyment of the headphone with equalization.  Maybe with time we get smarter about what these distortions mean.ConclusionsThe HEDDphone brings fresh new approach to building a headphone. It also presents a few significant compromises from size to weight and uneven low frequency response.  While we can't do much about the former two, equalization was quite effectively in lifting the performance of this headphone from nearly fail for such high price to, ""wow, this thing than sing!""I cannot recommend the HEDD HEDDphone.  It has too many compromises as is.  But with the right EQ, for someone who has other headphones and wants to try something different, it can provide excellent soundstaging/layering of instruments and overall tonality.NOTE: new rules on what can be posted in review threads will be enforced.  So take caution in making generalizations and keep your comments specific to this headphone and its results.  General complaints, rants and such will result in sanctions.

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,995.  You get to choose your cable length and type which can add another $50 to the cost.The Diana V2 is extremely light and has exquisite build and attention to detail:It almost melted on my head as soon as I put it on, getting very close to perfect for me.  Note that the test sample has an aftermarket pad on the headband:Without it, it may have been less comfortable.  I see reports online saying the paint chips easily which if so, would be a serious concern in this price range.The pads are very soft and attached with powerful magnets and four pins so you can rotate them or change them for another (I have the ""DMS"" pads which I may test next).The softness of the pads presented serious challenges in measurements.  Mere lifting them and letting good would change bass response by as much as 5 dB!  I am not talking about moving the pads.  Just pulling and letting go.  Not only did the bass change, so did the response above 5 kHz.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result.Abyss Diana V2 MeasurementsLet's start with the Diana V2 frequency response measurements:The above is actually the fourth set of measurements I made!  I initially made a measurement that looked similar to above.  But then noticed one of the pads was rotated 90 degrees relative to the other.  I fixed that and upon measurements, the results were quite different.  I developed a new EQ based on that and results were quite poor, sounding worse than the no EQ and the first pass EQ.  I made another measurement and spent another hour creating an EQ, once again resulting in failure.  That is when I discovered what I said at the outset.  That while the pads nicely rest on the measurement rig, slight deformation of them radically changed the response especially in the 2 to 6 kHz region.Since the first result was most agreeable I attempted to replicate that and came close with what you see above.  Equalization this time worked even better than my first pass, giving me comfort that this measurement is closest to the ""truth.""  Still, I want to highly caution you to not blindly program EQ based on the graph above.  Notice how for example the two channels have different peaks and by good bit.I even found the filtering I was applying to the relative response was causing me to chase the wrong thing so I reduced that fair bit (1/24th octave now):Other than the typical loss of sub-bass, the problem we have is slight peaking around 1 to 1.5 kHz and major shortfall between 2 and 10 kHz.  You might be tempted to go and fill that large hole with EQ but careful.  Look at this distortion graph:Ouch!  The two areas we want to fill in, the bass and the treble are the two with the highest distortion!  Any boost in these areas could cause harshness due to harmonic distortion increasing the high frequency energy.  This can cause brightness and ear fatigue.  Even doing nothing you are faced with the above situation.To show how bad the distortion is, let's zoom out:It doesn't look to me that any effort was spent in analyzing distortion in this driver and attempting to mitigate it.  We have seen plenty of headphones with much lower distortion and a number with almost none (relative to bass) in upper frequencies. The distortion mechanism here is complex as its peak frequency is level sensitive.  Notice how the green curve peak that represents 114 dBSPL fore example, is 1 to 2 khz lower than that of 104 dBSPL.In absolute terms, distortion exceeds our 40 db thresholds in the two areas we already know about:Group delay is quite messy, likely due to internal resonances which combine with the direct sound, creating complex interactions:Impedance is flat but low:Finally, sensitivity is the worse of any headphone we have measured so far:I had to really floor my headphone amp to get it to sing so above graph is pretty correct.Abyss Diana V2 Listening Test and EqualizationIn stock configuration, the sound is rather dull, gritty and lacks any deep bass.  On the latter, in my tracks with deep bass, you basically would hear nothing.  This is how I knew the curve that showed the roll off you see in the measurement section was the correct one.  I am going to blame the grittiness on high distortion.  Spatial qualities were not there either.  Was the sound offensive?  Other than the grittiness, no.  But you don't spend this much money on a headphone to get inoffensive sound.As I noted earlier, my first pass EQ went pretty easy last night.  I should have left well enough alone but did not so had to start all over this afternoon.  After some four hours and listening to ton of tracks, this is the final outcome:There is a ton of tuning by ear here.  The trickiness was that boosting the 2 to 4 kHz would cause brightness which I don't like.  One of the solutions to that was the little dip in yellow. I was pleasantly surprised that the Diana V2 could handle any amount of bass boost I threw at it!  For grins, I pumped that to 12 dB and it kept on playing and producing more low bass without bottoming out, cracking or anything of the sort!  Paradoxically, it would cause some brightness due to high harmonic distortion spreading into upper bands but the bass remained under control itself.  You would need to tune this for yourself.  What I have up there is the best compromise.  Anything higher would require massive amount of headroom to avoid digital clipping which in turn require tons more amplification gain.  Maybe you want to create multiple profiles and switch between them depending on what you play.Once this EQ was in place, the bass was naturally improved and I could now hear and enjoy the sub-bass quite well.  It was neat to have my ear-lobes resonate with bass even at moderate playback levels.  The sound was now more open and spatial (""soundstage"") quality improved.  Overall the transformation was not large but very much welcome.Alas, the grittiness, while reduced some, still remained.  I did not like strings for example in classical music.  There is just too much distortion in this driver to be able to do anything about this.  As a result, I could not listen to the headphones for long.  It was a relief to take it off and switch to my much larger headphone at the end.ConclusionsOn the physical side, I think you are getting decent offering in the form of ""luxury"" when it comes to this headphone.  Unfortunately, nothing like that comes along on the fidelity front.  Both subjectively and objectively there is no there there.  I like to see near perfection as far as distortion is concerned even if they thought different tonality was merited than our target.  At the same time I can't imagine anyone being able to make a good case that you should have a chunk of your spectrum taken out from the lower to middle treble.  This is where a lot of ""air"" and sense of ""hi-fi"" exists in music.Equalization was hampered by difficulty in measuring the headphone and the fact that distortion can work against you, creating more harshness and artifacts as you attempt to fill in the holes.  I don't mind distortion if the response is too high in that region.  That way, I can pull it down and both fix tonality and reduce distortion.  Here we have the reverse situation.I really liked the feel of having this bit of luxury on my ears and the comfort it brought.  And with EQ, good experience for a while at least.  But just couldn't go far enough to fix all the ills of the design.  Company needs to work on V3 with the goal of killing the distortion in mid frequencies where our hearing is so sensitive.In summary, I can't recommend the Abyss Diana V2.  Yes, I have read the other reviews where people say they died and gone to heaven after listening to this headphone.  Don't ask me to rationalize their experiences.  I am here to rationalize mine.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
4000,81f841ce-c588-4e60-95b6-cd981b439e10,Over Ear,Dan Clark Audio,Expanse,665.0,9/12/22,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/dan-clark-expanse-headphone-review.37332/,23.0,"This is a review, listening tests and measurements of the Dan Clark Expanse open-back planar magnetic headphone. It was loaned to me by the company and costs US $3999.The design takes that of Stealth headphone to another level with nicely done grill on the outside.  It is very comfortable to wear, nicely molding to my head.  You have a choice of cable connectors (I received the balanced XLR one).  The cable itself is quite thick and sturdy but nicely drapes so no complaints there.Dan Clark Expanse MeasurementsLet's start with our frequency response and comparison to target:Prior to measurement company had told me that it complied with the target but that they had dialed in a boost in that 100 too 300 Hz region as you see.  We will evaluate this in the listening tests.  For now, compliance to the target is the best of any open-back headphone that I have tested.  It is only approximated by the company's own closed back Stealth headphone.If you do want to create an EQ, here is the relative frequency response:Note that measurements above 7 to 8 kHz are generally not accurate but I put a cursor there in case you want to play with that dip.   Here is the group delay as areas to avoid (sharp spikes):Vast majority of headphones show very messy group delay indicating mixing of phase due to reflections and or resonances in the headphone. Dan Clark headphones are an exception showing clear attention to keep these factors at bay.Distortion at two playback levels is exceptionally low:We get a SINAD of 86 dB which is limited by the measurement noise rather than true distortion of the headphone.  For a transducer, it is basically distortion-less.  There is a hump at 114 dBSPL but note that this headphone requires no boosting in low frequencies so that again, is excellent.  Here is our absolute distortion at 94 dBSPL:We have so much margin in the critical audible band of 2 to 5 kHz.Impedance is a departure from typical planar headphone by showing some variation in low frequencies:So likely some electronic components are in the path to provide the bass response we saw in the frequency response graph. Not an issue though as the variation is relatively small.Sensitivity is very low so you better have good headphone amplification:On my RME ADI-2 Pro, average listening level was about -6 dB.  I could get more volume but even at max volume, I could not get the headphone to distort.Edit: here is the impulse response:Dan Clark Expanse Listening TestsThe small deviation in bass made subjective testing critical to assess whether that is or is not a good idea.  I developed a correction for the filter (initially at -3 dB but later changed to -2 dB):Listening with stock tuning, I enjoyed warmth that it added to my reference female vocals.  Defeating it using EQ caused the vocals to stand out more, with slightly more spatial qualities. But the tonality comparatively could be said to be a bit bright. I preferred it without EQ.  Moving to other clips, I occasionally would hear a bit of tubbiness which was made better with EQ. This was in cases where the tubbiness was already in the music and the boost in the response of the headphone exaggerated it a bit.  Overall, I would say 70% of time of I preferred no EQ.  For the others, if I didn't have EQ, it would still be delightful to listen to headphone.  We are talking small differences here.That bit aside, the superbly clean sound with very good spatial qualities and tonality that was right on the money, made the experience super enjoyable.  On tonality the sound was familiar as in the sense of listening to a reference studio monitor but with none of the room modes.  Low level detail was stunning at times in the way they would stand out with superb clarity.ConclusionsWhat more could you ask for when a company delivers a headphone that both objectively and subjectively delivers on tonality, spatiality (instrument separation) and vanishingly low distortion?  I know, you want it cheaper.    But this is the price right now for this unique offering in open back planar magnetic headphones.  It is times like this that makes my ""job"" a delight!It is my pleasure to recommend Dan Clark Expanse headphone.  Delivering on best of audio science matters and matters a lot.  Company's commitment to this is admirable.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
500,2d3a7279-e282-406b-9cf9-0b33517c9a47,Over-Ear,Dan Clark Audio (MrSpeakers),AEON RT,677.0,1/14/21,https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/dan-clark-audio-aeon-rt-review-closed-headphone.19393/,13.0," Dan Clark √ÜON RT closed back headphone.  It was kindly sent to me by the company for testing and costs US $500.In a sea of similar looking headphones, the √ÜON RT manages to distinguish itself with a uniqe shape:This makes the cup smaller which can be good for travel although I find that it almost touches the top of my ears.  Clamp pressure is a tad high for my head causing a bit of strain after a few hours of use.The pads feel soft and luxurious.  A set of filter pads are supplied that get mounted inside to control the level of high frequencies.  A white pad with one notch comes installed.  I took it out as it attenuates too much of the high frequencies and likely causes some slight comb filtering as well.The supplied cable is rather soft for this type of cord and comes with nice click on, 4-pin connectors for each side:The headband is infinitely adjustable and is comprised of very soft leather.Overall this is a stylish headphone that comes close to being very comfortable for me to wear.Dan Clark √ÜON RT MeasurementsThe frequency response of AEON RT comes closest to our preference target, especially in low bass, than any headphone I have tested so far:As you see, the deep bass response almost matches our preference down to 20 Hz.  Removal of the white pad causes the right side to exceed our target (without it, it matched it more or less).  So what is really left to address is the shortfall in the 2 to 5 kHz.  This is where ""openness"" of sound comes from.  Dan says he doesn't think complying with the target generates what he hears live.  I agree with him on that, but disagree on desirability of it in the arsenal of the audiophile. I like that energy there!   And indeed, get it with speakers that have flat on axis response in that region.  Anyway, we will test this in the equalization section.Plotting the deviation from our target, this time with both channels showing, shows us the compliance:If you let your eyes average out the ups and downs some, and ignore the oscillations on the right, you can see that we are pretty close to our target (for a headphone measurement anyway).But here is the best part about this headphone, distortion level:Wow!  With speakers I celebrate when distortion is below 0.5% at high frequencies at 96 dBSPL.  Here, we are below 0.5% across the entire audio band!  Even at 104 dBSPL distortion remains highly under control.  It is only at 114 dBSPL that it starts to complain a bit but even there, it is better than some other headphones at 94 dBSPL!  Remember our recently measured Abyss Diana V2 for example?Can you even compare the two?  Both are planar magnetic technology but the AEON RT is clearly engineered to not distort.In absolute terms we get this level of THD distortion:We clear the 40 dB hurdle easily and with substantial margin in 2 to 5 kHz where our hearing is most sensitive.Group delay graph is quite ""sane"" indicating we don't have tons of resonating surfaces interacting with each other:The sharp spikes on the right are due to reflections and frequencies you don't want to touch with EQ.  The only thing of note is the dip at 153 Hz which coincides with the same in frequency response.Impedance is very flat which is good (typical of planar magnetic drivers) but also very low:You need a very good phone amplifier that does well in my 32 ohm tests.  Efficiency is also quite low making this point even more important:√ÜON RT Headphone Listening Tests and EqualizationI originally listened to the AEON RT with the included white pad with one notch in it.  I did not find the sound very exciting but also not problematic either.  Taking the pad out completely transforms the sound.  Yes, it becomes a bit bright so I can see why the pad is included.  But due to very low distortion, the slightly elevated highs are not at all annoying.  It is just a tonality preference.  I rather fix that with EQ than with the pad as I have much more control.  So let's dial in a few corrections as we don't need much:This is the first headphone I have tested which reproduces sub-bass frequencies with no EQ.  But you know me: I like a bit more.    So I dialed in some.  You are welcome to do that or leave it alone.  But do note that this increase helps balance a bit of brightness at the other end of the spectrum where I have a shelf to bring down the highs a bit.The main corrections are the two dips in the frequency response, one at 153 Hz and the other, around 2.8 kHz.  The former you could leave out but I found that it helped with male vocals at the level I have it.  The other tweak however, opens up the sound and improves spatial (soundstage) quality quite a bit.With all the corrections, AB tests showed that I could live with no EQ as well but prefer it with EQ.  You may lean one way or the other.  This is the first time where EQ has not made a super decisive improvement.With this EQ in place, there is such a delightful accuracy and ""correctness"" that I fail to describe in words.  Usually I am fighting brightness with other headphones created by high distortion, tonality of both.  Here, everything is squeaky clean.   The sound easily beats some of the best speakers in the world.  It is tonally balanced, extends deep, deep into lows like few speakers can ever produce.  The high frequency notes delight with brief presence and no exaggeration.ConclusionsIt has taken us a dozen or so headphone reviews to get us a stellar specimen in the form AEON RT.  Tonality is almost good enough without any EQ for those of you who don't have access to EQ.  With EQ, it rises another class and delights.  This accomplishment is more exceptional than it seems because there are so few choices of closed headphones.  I sit next to my noisy audio analyzer all day and need to have closed headphone.   I finally have one that does justice to my music library.Was this an accident?  Nope.  Dan measures his headphones in their development and as such, has been able to find and fix everything I would discover.  I was able for example to get frequency response measurements which while were done on slightly different setup, correlated well with mine.  He told me distortion would be low, and what they had to do to eliminate measurement errors.  Fortunately I was right there with them with optimization of my setup at the outset, so was able to confirm that.Really, get the tonality right, remove factors that cause distortion and you are there as far as performance.  We have seen this in electronics where companies that do their homework during development smell like roses in my reviews and measurements.  We seem to have found the first company in that regard when it comes to headphones.Needless to say, I am very happy to put the Dan Clark √ÜON RT closed headphone on my recommended list.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

A member was kind enough to purchase one new and drop ship it to me due to request from membership!  The DT990 costs about $160 and has been around for many years.I like the look of the DT 990:The pads felt hard at first but after just a couple of hours of use, they became more comfortable.  Combined with light weight of the unit, they are nice to wear.I did not care as much for the plastic cups, nor the sharp edges of meta pieces:The cups are round and large making for easy fit not only around your ears but also the measurement gear.  I have never had a headphone so easy to mount on my fixture to measure.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro MeasurementsLet's start with frequency response of DT 990 and comparison to our preference target:We have some serious issues here.  The headphone is tuned to produce its max bass output at around 150 Hz below which it drops rapidly.  Inverse is in play above 2 kHz where we way overshoot.   Predicted response then would be a bit boomy and very sharp and bright.  Here is the same as relative measure:Bad news doesn't stop there.  Distortion is quite high:The DT990 is also extremely insensitive:You better have a very  high performance headphone amplifier that can drive its high impedance and provide the required power:Notice how 250 ohm is the minimum impedance.  Close to tuning frequency of the headphone, it shoots up to 350 ohm so your headphone amp needs to also have a very low output impedance as to not impact the frequency response of this headphone.   Heaven knows you don't want to mess up the response of this headphone any more than it already is!Group delay response shows some areas you don't want to eq as usual (shown as dip in frequency response) and some fuzziness that I rather not see:Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro Headphone Listening Tests and EQIt took all of a few seconds to want to rip the DT 990 off my head as I always start with female vocals and this headphone shred the vocals to pieces.  And proceeded to drill into your head with those shards!  This thing is so bright that it brought high frequencies resonances that I did not even think were in the music!  This stood out even more because there is little sub-bass energy.  The peaking around 150 Hz provides a bit of help there but also can sound a bit boomy on some content.Distortion was a serious problem.  At moderately high level it would add this warbling sound to many tones from vocals and some lower notes.  At higher levels bass notes would start to create ticking sounds.  You wouldn't normally listen that this level though so it is an engineering failure more than audible one (without EQ).I am always hopeful that I can fix headphones with EQ but my first two tries last night were met with failure.  This headphone's main saving grace is its rather good spatial qualities.  Alas, fixing the high frequency peaks and levels by eye killed that aspect and still left the nastiness that was in there at times.  Any attempt to boost the bass frequencies resulted in nasty bass distortion and worse warbling sound per above.Right when I was going to give up, I decided to use an assisted method to develop the EQ.  I swept the headphone and manually dialed in EQ settings and iterated to get rid of the peaking in three high frequency bands.  This was the result:Focusing on the left, I had dialed in some 6 dB yet the effect was minimal in response.  I pushed that up to eve 10 dB and the graph simply did not change indicating the driver is out of gas.  Audible effect of that bass boost was horrible with distortion galore.  So I took that out.  I then found the sound to be rather dull and spatial effects compromised.  So I dialed in a shelving filter that boosted the entire range.  This was the final result:You can mess with that shelfing filter (Band 5) to your taste.  On some content I wanted it higher, on some others, less.  The latter is what I am showing here. I must say, I was surprised how this finally salvaged the headphone sound.  I am listening to it as I type this and it almost sounds ""normal"" in a good way!    Mind you, if you turn up the level too much, the warbling sound comes to haunt you but that is likely not your everyday level.ConclusionsWhile the DT 990 Pro is a comfortable headphone to wear, it has a seriously flawed design with poor frequency response which exaggerates the heck out of highs and dumps a bunch of distortion in there for good measure.  It also lacks deep bass reproduction.  Careful equalization did manage to salvage it at the end but took a lot of doing.I am not going to recommend the Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro.  It is just too broken.  Even though EQ helped a lot, it is still an inefficient headphone with high distortion.  If you have one, use my EQ and comment on how you like it.  Otherwise it is a pass with or without EQ.  Let's hope we can find a headphone as comfortable as this but with much better engineering.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs S$999 (US $750).Other than the cheesy logo and rough finish of the metal parts, the headphone ""looks the part"" as our British friends would say.  It is exceptionally comfortable and fit on my head nicely.  A pair of velour pads and what looks to be half a dozen filters also come with it.  I stuck with the unit as shipped (as shown above).  There is no documentation with the unit so I don't know what the filters do (if anything different).A high-end looking balanced cable comes with the unit.The claim to fame of this headphone is that it is supposed to be clone or close to Hifiman Susvara/HE-6 at a much cheaper price.Note: The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. Headphone measurements by definition are approximate and variable so don't be surprised if other measurements even if performed with the same fixtures as mine, differ in end results. Protocols vary such as headband pressure and averaging (which I don't do). As you will see, I confirm the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers mostly in bass and above a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests. If you think you have an exact idea of a headphone performance, you are likely wrong!Fitment on the fixture was superb once I expanded the headband to near max.Nan-6 Headphone MeasurementsAs usual we start with the headphone frequency response as comparison to our preference curve:Compliance is decent from 150 Hz to about 1.5 kHz.  Outside of that range we have some deficiency.  There is fair bit of roughness in the measurements and one channel deviates from the other in the 2 to 3 KHz region which may indication lack of production quality assurance.Here is the response of Hifiman HE-6 by the way:There is better channel matching but the HE-6 has that notch around 7 kHz which the Nan-6 remedies.Relative response shows that we don't have a lot to fix:Distortion was impressively low at my two lower measurement levels:We will have to boost a couple of regions though so there will be some degradation in practice.Typical of this class of headphone/driver, impedance is low and flat:You need a high current headphone amplifier to drive the Nan-6 given the very low sensitivity:Finally, group delay is messy which likely goes with the roughness in the frequency response:Nan-6 Headphone Listening TestsI unplugged my everyday Dan Clark Stealth headphone out of my RME ADI-2 DAC/Amp and loss in output level was quite apparent.  The Nan-6 is about half as sensitive.  I could drive it to everyday listening level at max level but bass response was anemic.  So I fed the output of the ADI-2 DAC to Topping A90 and now I could drive them well enough to clear ear cobwebs.   I was however surprised that I could get the drivers to crackle pat 3:00 o'clock.  Based on distortion measurements, I did not think I could overdrive them.  So maybe I was past 114 dBSPL.  Anyway, without EQ the sound is pleasant and definitely usable.  Add the bit of bass boost and especially the 3 kHz raise and the sound opens up subtly but nicely. Edit: forgot the EQ curve:You have have very dynamic response with more open air.  Spatial qualities are excellent with EQ and just a bit less so without.  Other than needing a bunch of power, there was not much to complain about.  I wanted to sit there and keep listening but had to stop to take picture and post the review....ConclusionsObjective flaws in response of the Nan-6 is easy to identify and fix.  Once there, the sound is excellent if you have a powerful and clean headphone amplifier.  You can use lessor amplification but you won't have any headroom to enjoy the bass response (with EQ) that this headphone can deliver.  Whether it is close to the headphones it is supposed to clone, I let you all argue that.  I am going to recommend the Nan-6 headphone and especially so with equalization.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It is on kind loan from a member.  The Ab-1266 comes in three different configurations with the ""Lite"" version costing US $4995.  The one I have is the Complete configuration costing $7,995 with the $3000 extra going to a replacement cable (!).I must say, in person this headphone looks better than when you see someone wearing them:Once on your head, you may remind people of Frankenstein.   Unlike many headphones, the premium cable serves two purposes:First function is to provide sound to each driver.  The second one is as a tow rope should your car get stuck in mud or snow!!! I mean good grief, this thing is so heavy and long that you are constantly figuring out how to route it as to not tug on the headphone or be a trip hazard.  Sadly premium cables are sold by weight and size so I guess it had to be for $3,000.  No, I did not have any other cables to test with and compare.The headphone is naturally quite heavy at 665 grams but wears almost comfortably.  There is no real spring action here.  You adjust the width of the headphone so that it more or less hangs next to your ears.  With some force, you can lengthen or shorten the top headband.  It was barely long enough for my fixture (you can bend it to make it wider).  Company -- unusually so -- recommends to try wearing them with some gap between them and your ears.  I avoided that and measured the headphone with the tightest fit I could, lest there be riots in the streets due to bass response.The cups are deep, very deep at average of 34 mm.  No risk of your ears hitting the drivers.  They are oval with height of 70 mm and and width of 56.  Very strong magnets hold the cups against the headphone.  You can pull it off and rotate it at another angle.  I left it as the owner sent me (see first picture above).Note that this unit is the forth generation one (latest available now).The measurements you are about to see are made using a standardized Gras 45C. I searched for any and all measurements I could find online. Alas while a number of them are close to mine, none are using the exact fixture down to coupler and pinna. As you will see, I have confirmed the approximate accuracy of the measurements using Equalization and listening tests. Ultimately headphone measurements are less exact than speakers specially in bass and a few kilohertz so keep that in mind as you read these tests.Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC MeasurementsAs usual we start with our frequency response:Hmmm.  Hard to imagine what target curve they were going after.  There are clearly anomalies that I can't imagine are intentional or if they are, misguided to be sure.  The main good news is that there is plenty of bass response and that we have more energy than we need in mid-range so we can pull that down and lower distortion as well.In relative form, we have:Company talks a lot about imaging/spatial effects of this headphone but seeing the shortfall in the critical midrange, they left a lot of money on the table.Next comes a very scary graph:As with Abyss Diana headphone I tested, we have a ton of distortion.  Company would do well to pay attention to this and work to find the cause and remedy them.  That said, my listening tests at modest levels produced very clean sound prompting me to go back to this measurement and realizing that the distortion at 94 dBSPL is actually quite low.  Here it is by itself:Considering how much sub-bass energy we already have, we don't need to boost much so what we see here is what we get.  Cranking up the volume clearly causes much distortion though in a binomial distribution in both bass and treble (previous graph).  Usually our only enemy is bass distortion -- not here.  More on this in listening tests.Here is the distortion as level:Group delay shows the common messiness in mid-frequencies:We have a going hypothesis that this is an indication of good spatial effects as it shows interference from multiple sources, i.e. reflections.  Messiness in lower range though is not welcome although audible effect of such is unknown.Impedance is dead flat and low as we expect in planar magnetic drivers:On sensitivity, this is the second worst I have measured:You roughly need four times the voltage to drive it to the same loudness as Sennheiser HD-650 for example.Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC Listening Tests and EqualizationHeadphone measurements are approximate.  The best way to verify their correctness is to modify the headphone response the way they instruct us and see if the effect is positive or not.  Before that though, I listened to the 1266 by itself.  I didn't find the sound all that exciting.  It wasn't terrible mind you but clearly it was colored.  So out came the parametric EQ:Note that the response curve is very odd shaped which makes matching them to parametric EQ curves is hard.  I eyeballed them and fortunately the result was fantastic.  Tonality improved substantially and clarity improved, likely due to reduction of distortion (my guess).  Most wonderful was the spatial effects.  You had this really nice halo at and behind your head that seemed to constantly delight in the way it would place instruments.  Deep bass was substantial with my modest boost and clean, clean and clean!  I listened for hours and didn't want to stop.To check distortion and clipping, I turned up the volume during some instrumental female vocals.  As I did the highs got a bit distorted and suddenly I was greeted with oddest buzzing sound!  It literally went from paying music to playing noise.  Fortunately that was pretty loud so don't expect it to be everyday problem.  With music that was bass heavy, the AB-1266 can produce a ton of them until starts to make a ticking sound with bass peaks.  Turn it up even more and they get louder still.  Again, this is beyond normal use and onset is mild.  Both of these experiences match the distortion measurements where we saw problems at multiple frequencies and not just bass.  These drivers are simply not designed to be pushed hard.Speaking of pushing, I used my Topping A90 in highest gain setting using balanced out.  It had no trouble driving the headphone to highest levels per above.  My RME ADI-2 DAC that I normally use doesn't have balanced headphone out so I routed its line output to A90 for listening tests.ConclusionsTechnically the Abyss AB-1266 has fair bit of objective faults.  Its frequency response varies with no rhyme or reason and it distorts at higher volumes.  The former is very correctable using equalization.  The latter just requires listening at normal levels.  Even putting aside the $3000 for the cable upgrade, this is one expensive headphone.  Would I go out and buy one?  No.  If I did, would I keep it without EQ?  No.  But if I had had, I would apply this EQ (or a refinement thereof) and enjoy the sound.  It becomes a very capable entertainer then.Without EQ, I cannot recommend the Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC.  With equalization, it becomes a delight and I recommend it, ignoring the price.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"

It was kindly loaned to me by a member.  There are different versions of this headphone in the wild.  This is the ""4-screw"" version.   The HE-6 has been discontinued.  When available, it cost US $1,300.The HE-6 has a serious look to it and beefy metal parts:I think the wiring provided are aftermarket.The large cups allowed it to instantly fit on my head with excellent comfort despite its above average weight. The cup is round and its inside diameter is 60 millimeters.  The depth is 18 millimeters.Note: The measurements you are about to see are preformed using standardized GRAS 45CA headphone measurement fixture. Headphone measurements require more interpretation than speaker tests and have more of a requirement for subjective testing as a result. In addition, comparison of measurements between different people performing it using different configurations requires fair bit of skill. So don't look for matching results. Focus on high level picture. Listening tests are performed using RME ADI-2 DAC and its headphone output.Mounting the headphone on my test fixture was challenging, resulting in quite a lot of variation between channels and overall response. I optimized this as best as I could but like there are some error in low frequencies.Hifiman HE-6 MeasurementsBefore I show the measurement let me state that this was the easiest headphone to measure by far.  I just put it on my test rig and it instantly registered equal levels in both cups.  And furthermore, the level barely changed when I switched to a low frequency of 80 Hz.  It was a joy in this regard!Let's start with frequency response of HE-6 and comparison to our preference target to figure out tonality of the headphone:Now you see what I meant by ease of measurements.  See how the response is ruler flat and matching in both cups from 20 Hz to almost 1.5 kHz!  I have never seen such precision before.  Yes, our preferred response asks for more bass but this is a great baseline to have instead of drooping, or jagged response.  Someone had a target of flat response there and got it!  Beyond 1 kHz, we have some shortfall from target followed by excessive peaking and exaggerated highs.  Neither is very extreme though:Check out the distortion levels:At 94 and 104 dB, there is essentially no distortion from 20 Hz to 10 kHz!  114 dBSPL brings out some unhappiness between 1 and 2 kHz.  We can see that there must be multiple sound sources from the group delay:Low frequency response though is textbook accurate with that sloping down graph.  Again, I don't recall seeing another headphone that clean in that region.Back to distortion, the HE-6 passes my 40 dBSPL threshold with flying colors:The HE-6 has a reputation for being very inefficient, needing ton of power and we can see that in my testing:It is in a class by itself there.Typical of planar magnetic transducers, impedance is flat and low:Hifiman HE-6 Listening TestsI remember testing the HE-6 a couple of weeks ago for another purpose and saying, ""hey, this is not bad!""  Same impression held this time around.  The sound is very clean with just a bit of high frequency exaggeration.  What bass there is, is good enough baseline that you could live with.  Still, I went after its response to matching to our preference better and the sound improved by a good notch or two:I arbitrary dialed in that sub-bass EQ.  It worked well enough to bring out that region without changing the overall impression of bass or making the headphone boomy.  I put in a shelving filter to pull the highs down and that worked well.  I think brought down the resonance around 4.3 kHz and compensated with pulling up the 2 kHz.Once there, the transformation was impressive.  Spatial effects were reasonable before but now were incredibly satisfying.  It felt like you had your head inside a medium sized dull house with an orchestra playing!  I wish I still had the Sennheiser HD800S with me to compare.  From memory though, I think the HE-6 is close if not the same as its magical response in this regard.  I am assuming the large cups and spacing from the ear is responsible for this open sound.With equalization, I really had no other wishes for this headphone.  It was comfortable and produced incredible fidelity.  Everything was there from clean bass to detail and resolution.  And oh, I was driving it with Topping A90 which could drive it quite loud on high gain.  I also tested it on RME ADI-2 DAC V2 and it too managed to drive it.  So no, you don't need a power (speaker) amplifier to drive it.  High performance amplifiers I have been recommending can mange it.I liked the sound of HE-6 so much that while working on the review, I was playing my selection of music with it and constantly saying, ""wow, that sounds good!""ConclusionsIt is a shame this headphone is discontinued and was expensive to boot.  Objectively the performance is quite good with distortion being a stand-out in addition to good amount of bass out of box.  With four filters, the sound is transformed not only tonally, but also from imagine/spatial qualities, differentiating from other headphones.I am going to put the HE-6 four-screw version on my recommended list. With EQ, it lands in my ""highly recommended"" bucket.  Will be sad to let this go.FYI, I have asked the owner to chime in and explain exactly what it is that I tested.    He also lent me some other mods but I have not tried to assess them.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/"
